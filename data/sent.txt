being a pc user my whole life
this computer is absolutely amazing
#num plus hours of battery
super fast processor and really nice graphics card
and plenty of storage with #num gb though i will upgrade this and the ram
this computer is really fast and i m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to
i ve only had mine a day but i m already used to it
macs are amazing
get this computer for portability and fast processing
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it
as a lifelong windows user i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac
as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more
without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere
i highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college
a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document
oh my goodness i am not a happy camper
my hp is very heavy
not easy to carry
the battery has never worked well
the battery gets so hot it is scary
yet hp won t do anything about the problem
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for #num months
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem
so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item
currently if i use the laptop i can t sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am
well they don t care a bunch
but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful
and if you are going to deal with hp be careful
in my house hp is a nasty word
since i purchased my toshiba netbook i have been very pleased with it i have a laptob and a desktop
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me
the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop
i have not have any problems
the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me
he gave me this pc about #num years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it
its still going
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality
this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this
it can t get any better
waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac
this laptop meets every expectation and windows #num is great
it s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network
it s even easy to hook up to other wireless networks
the battery doesn t last long but i m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem
i don t use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me
most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build
the only thing i don t understand is that the resolution of the screen isn t high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail
yes i have it on the highest available setting
i bought it for really cheap also and it s amazing
easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops
recommended to people as their first laptop
plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast
easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets
love that it doesn t take up space like a regular computer
i m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown
being a pc user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i m finding my way around
the unibody design is edgy and durable
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more
i m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages
granted it s still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops my mac boots up noticeably quicker
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular
i m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same
it s more expensive but well worth it in the long run
great product very easy to use and great graphics
one drawback i wish the keys were backlit
i m glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few #num extra dollars
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine
i wasn t really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise
i m very happy with this machine
i love the size keyboard the functions
i don t really have a complaint
it is easy to use good quality and good price
perfect trifecta
i would recommend this product
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it
this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it
i purchased this laptop #num months ago
the dvd burner broke after burning #num dvd d during that time
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within #num days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before
i spoke to #num different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a #num th person
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase
breaking within #num year of purchase and speaking to #num people to report the damaged part will be returned late
i do not recommend this company or their products
so far a great product
high price tag however
still trying to learn how to use it
it is the worst computer dell ever made
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one
breaks easily
only good thing is the graphics quality
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook
the #num reason that is always repeated
no viruses
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials
i am loyal to apple
the macbooks worth every penny
they re easy fun powerful and will last a long time
the great #num month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills which apple doesn t offer is why i bought my macbook at best buy
i am very happy
this just keeps having it s hard drive replaced
acer won t replace the laptop
the manufacturer s warranty only covers replacement repair of parts
this thing is a lemon
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat
suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern
i was so excited to receive the toshiba l #num as a gift bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine
i have owned it only two months
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box
my first problem was with the pre loaded norton firewall security program
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived
it took toshiba tech support #num calls and #num different techs to correct the problem
then just the other day my left mouse button snapped
being only #num months old i am not a happy camper
buyer beware
this one in my opinion might be a lemon
it rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses #num times and i have not even had it for more then #num months
if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it
like the price and operation
some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc
but for the cost this is a winner
i absolutely love my mac
i can t imagine my life without it anymore
it s perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc
i ve haven t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i ve ever bought
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn t work
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it
i saved for this laptop for #num months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait
the display on this computer is the best i ve seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent
a little pricey but it is well well worth it
i ve been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back
it is amazing
in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working #num months of use which was frustrating
then after #num or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running
a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last
has a #num #num hour battery life
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me
it is easy to use and lightweight
was very much worth the price i paid
this netbook went bad on me after #num days
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired
three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work
took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it
do not buy it
it is the worst laptop ever
the image is great and the soud is excelent
i love ths notebook
i love the glass touchpad
easy learning curve
also the display is exceptional
i have loved this since i took it out of the box
the battery is really long
the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers
small and light weight
speakers too small to be of any real use
keyboard good sized and wasy to use
i like it
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis
needless to say not to happy with the product
this is a great machine
the design is awesome quality is unprecedented
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at the i #num macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance
it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made
consumer report recommended toshiba
am very glad i bought it great netbook low price
very good quality and well made
great pick for portability and affordability
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks i ve seen
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions
if you need an affordable entry level laptop this will fit the bill
i dislike the weight and size cubersome
i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers
overall it s ok
laptop is advertised as a #num but the casing looks like that of a #num
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases
peformance is good for the price
if you re not wanting to be mobile this is a good laptop to sit on a desk
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first #num months after purchasing it
not good for a person who gets online daily
may be better for the occasional web surfer
i just got this laptop for college and so far i am very happy with it
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school
it is so much easier to use
good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows #num
and toshiba is a quality supplier
i love this little one
the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel
i like it better than my big dell laptop
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell
great battery life
keyboard is reasonable size
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel
charger seems large for this class of computer
great laptop for the price works well with action pack games
the only thing that i have is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters would help if it was a little lighter then it is
but other then that i would give this product a #num in hafe stars
good for every day computing and web browsing
a great computer for light home use and business use
might not make the avid gamer happy but i don t really think that is what this computer is designed for
crisp screen great battery life and plenty of storage
very happy
my son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self employed so the family had no computer of any kind and kyle the oldest child is #num and really need something to help him in school
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet
i would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school
my only problem is i can not reg the product key
it want take it it keep saying error
help help other than that gets a great little wonder
it s fast and has excellent battery life
the screen shows great colors
i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop
the speed is fine
laptop is to be used like a netbook
but with a way bigger screen and is able to connect to an hdmi
love it
i would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop and the battery life is amazing
i bought this lap top and the charge time dosen t last as long as they say it will more like #num hours
this computer is the ideal college companion
it s software and speed enable it to do amazing things
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased
a cheaper price should not equal a cheap product
it was over rated
the toshiba laptop was a great purchase
the price was very good and the product is top quality
the delivery was fast and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again
this is my second laptop and it is head and shoulders above my first
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for
true quality at a great price
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great
toshiba is a great brand even though i haven t had it for a long time i am very happy with it
this is the first laptop i ve owned althougth i used several at my previous job
the screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great
i ve already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye d the computer when i took it out of my bag
i like the laptop overall
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work
this is a great little computer for the price
simple to use and great graphics
it has everything i would need for a home computer
i m very impressed
it was secure and easy to navigate
it is everything that i would want in a computer
besides the great look it is a great machine
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using the mac
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts
i enjoy very much my new toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling
i have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs
i have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access without having to have extra equipment and or complicated routes to take to be able to do so
i also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it a perfect tool for my academic studies
i am very pleased with my purchase
this laptop serves all my needs
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment
price and purpose is awesome
i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop
the battery life seems to be very good and have had no issues with it
great product
the laptop was very easy to set up
i did not have to call the support line at all
everything was so easy
i purchased two laptops for my husband and #num year old daughter
my husband uses it mostly for games email and music
my daughter uses it for games email facebook pictures and music
they were able to set up with labtops themselves within a few minutes
it works fine with our wireless and they ve had not problems
it s a great product for a great price
waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac
purchased as a gift for a friend
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance picture quality and ease of use
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere
just what the doctor ordered
#num nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection
i cannot be happier with the service or product
power supply went bad after #num weeks
after much effort and #num days asus replaced it
the wifi is very weak
i have other computers that get strong signals that don t drop in places that this net book loses its signal
summary spend your money elsewhere
this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life
love it so far
the toshiba net book operates very well
the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows #num system is a starter and charges for the upgrade
i bought this netbook for traveling and it s great light functional and meets my needs
the touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback
otherwise i love it
i shopped around before buying
i wasn t really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money
it was a great deal after all
i love it
i should have bought one a long time ago
not enough time for me to give it #num stars
i ve had the macbook pro #num for about three weeks and it really is a great computer
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it s speed
it is fast booting up shutting down and connection with the internet
the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel
i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but i rather have a hard copy
if what you need is a machine to do some surfing email checking word processing and watching a movie or two this is the machine you want
it s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box
if you want a little more custom ability drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win #num and grab a #num gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more
i found a #num gb stick for a bit under #num
nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents
my only issues are
the screen video resolution won t increase to a higher resolution then #num x #num
that being said it still runs video in full screen decently
the sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones
bottom line i doubt you d be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine
okay let s just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy
i am a wife mom and a school teacher and a college student
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college
i use the computer to basically check emails surf the web print coupons and for my college papers
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my pc
it would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and i would be up hours just because the computer was too slow
my brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an apple
finally i couldn t take it anymore and ordered my apple
yes i thought the expese was a little much but i now realize you get what you pay for
i love my apple it is quick and easy to use
i ve had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful english speaking from vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me
i can t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket
money and time well spent
highly recommended
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for
the #num macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express
speakers doesn t sound that great
the battery life also doesn t keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack
this was an update from an early macbook pro
love the speed especially
so glad i decided to upgrade
thanks macconnection for making this a seamless purchase
i ve owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke
still under warrenty so called toshiba no help at all
i m stuck w a broken computer
will not buy another toshiba this is my second not happy w either
this is my #num rd apple laptop and first macbook pro
i love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now
excellent led monitor and well equipped
i love the apple products
the toshiba mini notebook model nb #num n #num bl is a great little computer
it is easy to use its keyboard easily accommodates large hands and its weight is fantasic
upgrading from windows #num starter thru windows #num home premium to windows #num professional was a snap
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key
other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive
ever since i bought this laptop so far i ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every #num months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them
it s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them
and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended
long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba
probably not ever again
i ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba
remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product
all i can say is w o w
this laptop is insane
it s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with
i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great
this is definitely a computer worth the money
the mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion offer going of course
overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you
obviously this macbook is p e r f e c t for me because it does exactly what i need in an easy to function way
definitely recommended
not a bad laptop it s a bit slow but gets the job done
the lcd screen stopped working on mine after #num months
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had #num months left on the warranty
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had #num months left on the warranty
dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture
english must have been his third or fourth language
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test and it was failing
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid
after #num days being denied #num times and told off once i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt
after that the said it was under warranty
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me
after they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they don t allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a #num page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn t be covered
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service
this computer gets very hot before shutting down
it is not ideal for children because of the temp
i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses without results
they didn t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement
i will never purchase a hp again ever
let s just get this out of the way i love apple
so this review might be a tad bit bias
but the macbook is the best
it is super easy to use
all you have to do is turn it on and it works
it is very durable i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet
i don t do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so i can t reccomend it if you are in the computer field
but if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn t be here
in the past four years i ve had it i have never once gotten a virus
i did have to replace the battery once but that was only a couple months ago and it s been working perfect ever since
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable easy to use computer
hope this helped
no laptop is perfect but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you
this laptop does everything i need it to very well
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room
the two of us use it regularly
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features
the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice
i find myself using the #num key more than i thought i would
battery is lasting about #num hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos
for those that care about noise this thing doesn t really make any
the i #num processor doesn t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff
once i removed all the software the laptop loads in #num #num seconds
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn t require a dedicated video card
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase
i looked around and based off my price features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here
great quick laptop for the money
right size and weight for portability
battery life needs more life
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery
both my husband and i have this model toshiba
i love everything about it
the only downfall is the battery only last #num #num #num #num hrs when not plugged in
i would like at least a #num hr battery life
otherwise all other features are a #num
this mac is great
lightweight long battery life excellent transition from pc
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it
i will never buy refurbished again i don t cae how cheap it is
i ll wait and save up for a new one
just don t waste your time and money on this
i tried giving it #num stars but i had to choose at least one but imo no stars
summary dont buy hp
if you buy pray you dont have major prolems
runs hot
i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product
unfortunately that is not the case
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro the monitor has completely died
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time we are on the hook for the repair
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure
in fact he said about #num of their products fail
hmmm that high failure rate sure isn t reflected in the retail price
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks and i am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it
this is the third macbook pro in our family
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated
then #num of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro
now they are believers in the product
it is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the macbook pro to get my work done
this little netboook is helping me get work done
i can do pretty much #num of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her it s very lightweight and the response for the computing she s doing internet focused activity mail research etc is excellent
she can t tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook
if you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics intensive game you d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market
previous laptops were pc s still have them but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade
probably as good as you can get in a netbook does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device
so far so good
i ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory
i don t understand why only windows #num starter is included
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed
this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers
enjoy that toshib force and durability unparalleled
needs longer lasting battery more than #num to #num hrs
needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side in the way of operating a mouse in small area
for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop
comfterbale to use light easy to transport
i love this product because it is toshiba and its #num #num
it has no camera but i can always buy and install one easy
i had a usb connect but i can t use it because it is not compatible
that s the downside for me
but i would recommend this product
satisfy what i paid for it
good monitor and performed well
i am using the external speaker sound is good
best thing is i can use existing #num bit old programs
i recommend for word processing and internet users
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried
the games included are very good games
i am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one
i would highly recommend this one to my friends
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio
it works great for general internet use microsoft office apps home bookkeeping etc
it doesn t have a lot of frills but i didn t need any and being able to buy what i needed and not more than i needed was very important
this computer i used daily nice compact design
excellent speed for processing data
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag
all in all great item highly recommend it
bought it to use mostly for oline classes
i would have to say that overall its great
aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of a webcam its great
fast great visual
oh yea has no numeric pad on the side
i use that alot on my desktop so i am adjusting to not having it
#num nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen
great wifi too
the screen is a little glary and i hated the clicking buttons but i got used to them
overall for the money this is a good deal
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better
while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite i like the extra features i love the windows #num home premium
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it so i m thrilled with that
i also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull
i would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend
couldnt not use it
tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk
defective software
returned it to walmart
this was the second computer and brand bought that day
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen
i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it
one of them seems to have worked
its a good laptop for its value
registration #num st use is easy
features like the font are very block like and old school
would like more trendy high tech features
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking
keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for #num days yet
came fully loaded good
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs programs etc simultaneously
i m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer
graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless
only issue is that it is a little slow and i m fixing that by adding more ram
sound card is limited though
the laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses
windows #num starter is terrific no you can t change the background but i don t need to i use it just for school work
the battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding
the ease of set up was terrific
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive
keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that i do
screen is crystal clear yes it s small but it s a netbook
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college
i couldn t believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge
i loaded windows #num via bootcamp and it works flawlessly
simply amazing computer
i really like the mac #num #num in notebook but its very pricey
heck i like all mac computers but they re all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u s is going through
love the graphics awesome programs including garageband and really cool default background
but like i said before the only reason i don t currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey
waiting for the i #num was well worth it great value for the price
bigger hd better graphics card and a bid hd
there is nothing to complain about the system
i have used pc s and converting to this macbook pro was easy
if you have the money i suggest going for the i #num
this is my first personal satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous satellite work issued laptops
i mainly use it for email internet and managing personal files pics vids etc
i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop
i ts nice to have the higher end laptops but this fits my budget and the features i need
i normally dont participate in reviews surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts
another satisfied customer
the apple macbook is the best investment that i have ever made
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about #num years
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers
i am a college student and it has been very useful
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes
iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily
i have owned macbook pros since #num and this is the best yet
i have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me
the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use very important for use quick typers
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems as well
overall this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase
the graphics are stunning
it s wonderful for computer gaming
i would definitely suggest this laptop
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all
it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc
in addition all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations
this comes in very handy for me as an educator
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click
in addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture
if you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops it is worth the price
this computer was awful
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company
the computer first started malfunctioning #num months after purchasing it
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it
the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all
when calling dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it
this computer was awful i would never recomend it to another person
those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall
yeah i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire
that s how frustrating it was
it is so simple to use i use it more than my desktop
it is well worth the money it cost very good investment
the new macbook pro #num inch i #num is nothing short of amazing
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied
yes a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there but there is no comparison in style speed and just cool factor
bought from wal mart i believe that this laptop was a repaired item
this laptop was bad from the first day of use brought it back to store for return of money
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops
will not every buy another lou
this is a great value for the money
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired
this is a great computer
we haven t had any problems with it at all
the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up
overall though for the money spent it s a great deal
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac
but let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer
for example when my husband turns the light out while i m on the computer the screen brightness automatically adjusts
the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard
it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted
oh it is such a great piece of equipment
one suggestion i do have is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs
having someone give you a quick tour of how to s is the best
so you don t get frustrated the first few weeks
i get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room
very long life battery up to #num #num hours depending on how you configure power level settings
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows #num starter to win #num home and it runs just fine
i play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big #num laptop does
i wouldn t play a first person shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruit named music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in i d highly recommend checking this out
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire #num #num hours of battery life five days a week
additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshiba specific software that may or may not be to a user s liking
i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at i think there s something to be said about the simplicity of macs
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point
love it love it love it
it really is perfect for work and play
i am able to play #num p and #num p media files just fine with it
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome
the only thing that isn t perfect about this netbook is the speakers they are not loud at all but i expected that
i upgraded it s ram to #num gb i am very happy with it
lots of preloaded software
the only problem is that i had to add #num gb ram the computer was kinda slow
tosiba has a good reputation my llast computer was an acer
this is starting off good
what a great little laptop
maybe not the cutting edge satellite l #num d but it is a workhorse
i bought it to use in college and it is perfect
i dual boot with linux and that other security prone os and it performs flawlessly
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba
excellent product for the money
no problems no lock ups no disappointments
not super fancy but not super expensive either
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed etc
highly recommend for daily use
we now own two of these identical
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed
two of the times was in one month
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose
this has happened three times so far
two times with in one month
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there
the mac book pro performs flawlessly
never had a single problem and don t have to worry about viruses
while i mostly use it for email internet and gaming i m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ve come to appreciate from mac laptops
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment
right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously
it even has a great webcam and skype works very well
the fact that you can spend over #num on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine
the windows #num starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics
i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks
i use this for my tutoring business and since i m always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the #num hours as advertised
finally i should note that i took the #num gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them
little short on ram but you get what you pay for
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch pad making the touch pad hard to use when using headphones mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction
i love windows #num but i can t give toshiba any credit for that unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l #num d s #num laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june #num and returned on july #num seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some #num miles by air to louisville ky
by air sounds more like by truck to me
and toshiba is totally unconcerned
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter
we don t mind and you don t matter
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you don t matter
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service
i ve tried going back to xl but there still problems
the technical service for dell is so #num rd world it might as well not even bother
just a bunch of idiots who s english as a #num th language is forced at best
i m all for saving money but dell needs to step it up
good price
basic computer
didn t work when shipped from walmart com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop same make model
it has worked fine
handles all my basic media needs easily
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not
it s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs
i ve had this laptop for about a month now
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part
the #num gb of ram is plenty able to run windows #num and at least #num or #num other programs with next to no slowdown
the ati graphics card is a huge plus definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built in card would have trouble with such as half life #num or even world of warcraft
my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range
other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi decent gaming capabilities
let me start with the good so awesome
great os fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port
this is my second macbook
the first one i had was a #num model not the pro
i fell in love with it
this one has had the same effect
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion so i kind of knew what i was getting but hadn t been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi touch features
the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual but substantive
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior
the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful
it is everything i d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy
for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy
it s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled lighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness
my real problem with it
the statement of #num hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it s a lie
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than #num #num hrs out of it
the first full charge of this battery got me only about #num full hours
enabling the battery timer is useless
the time remaining goes from #num hours plus to less than #num hours over the span of about #num minutes
it s a joke
it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something
i know what #num hrs of battery looks like
this ain t it
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot
if you buy this don t go into it expecting #num hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied
the pro is a great product i wish that the #num inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more
great product by apple with the new great looking design
this computer was bought because i wanted top of the line fast reliable ha
i actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than #num #num #num years only to get another hp compaq piece of crap
it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only #num months
so buyers beware
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after #num days
so we exchanged it for the same on and after #num hours it didn t work
i went with him and we picked this one
it is made better thicker and all out tough
i droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues
i love the easy to see screen and it works well for work persoal or just play
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba
i just love this lap top i just wish it were all silver or they had all black
that is my only complaint
love this laptop wonderful price for what you get
would pay more for it if i had too
i purchased a toshiba satellite m #num with harman kardon speakers in december of #num
it still serves me well both in business and home needs
it is however very heavy
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling
i am totally satisfied with my little toshie
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy
it is always reliable never bugged and responds well
i love the operating system and the preloaded software
i am a freelance graphic artist
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently
this machine delivers
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core #num quad running at #num #num ghz
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers
it is a bit heavy
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required
if that is the case for you i would suggest a pull behind solution when looking at cases
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in
this is an over sized #num inch laptop
most of the large bags are for a #num inch
you may need to special order a bag
it wouldn t fit in most #num inch bags
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard doesn t light up on this model
it also does not have bluetooth
pay attention to the specs if you want these options
you ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them
i should have been more observant
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing i took it for granted that these features were standard
they are not
overall still a very nice machine
boots up fast and runs great
i m pleased
the acer one compuer is a great computer
i didn t want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice
its fast has high definition quality in the videos
the pictures are clear as can be
if i had to buy another computer i would most definetly buy an acer one computer
heck if i had enough money i would but it as a gift for someone
im glad that it has such great features in it
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home
clear picture on it and everything
the one down side to it is that when i play a certin game on here it tends to freeze up sometimes but thats the only bad thing about this computer
the acer one computer that i bought is #num ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but i like the big screen on it
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies
im very happy with this computer
well i have to say since i bought my mac i won t ever go back to any windows
it s solid
love the stability of the mac software and operating system
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have won t work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it
it seems to be incompatible with everything else
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x
i love to use it it is esay and light
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm
i can use it for all of my needs
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer
the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly
the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion
the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a pc with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience
from the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine
the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it
the screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice
fast fast and fast the web pages just fly by
i had my iworks itunes email ms office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour
that includes transferring my music and movies
good bye blue screen and critical errors
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect unlike the pcs in our lives
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job
if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer
it is light and the battery last a very long time
very fast boot up and shut down
been a pc user for many many years
let me tell you this machine is great
purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing e mail etc
i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing
the only time i have restarted is during system updates
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one
ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro this thing holds its own
the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx #num functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one
i like it so much i bought another just for my wife
took it back as it was defective
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something
couldn t keep a page up you were working on
was a great deal i will give that
the laptop preformed pretty well
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once
it has times were it freezes for #num seconds and then starts again
the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks
the mouse is way way way to sensitve
i tried turning it done but it did nothing
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too
its not bad just very very annoying
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop
i am very happy with this laptop
for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance
first things first macbook pro has many applications to make life easier unlike the windows computers
amazing quality
plus stylish
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc
the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x
mac is not made for gaming
but there s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows
second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
was not happy with one of the programs on it
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial
also the extended warranty was a problem
the extended warranty for the #num and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu
overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves
i took #num #num years researching brands and prices of laptops
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased
so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority
the only thing i didn t learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection in case it gets broken or crashes etc
i don t have that additional money right now and therefore wouldn t have purchased it at this time
those things are very important vital even
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won t have to worry about a crash
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection
thank you
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning
it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem
well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you don t save your files and information everything will be lost
another issue i have with it is the battery
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge
it is not even a year old yet so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone
don t waste your money
this laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of the iphone
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs but now that i have i can t see myself going back to it
the laptop is gorgeous
it is sleek smooth and lightweight
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky
overall this laptop is great
it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics
it runs very quiet too which is a plus
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible
they only stay charged a little over an hour
laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery
this a starter notebook
the processor a amd semprom at #num #num ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations
it is a cheap throw together
save your money and go for a better device
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look
runs smooth and quick
i wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect
i love my new computer
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both
thank you for your great product
everything about this computer is easy to use
wonderful features
the only thing is that the battery won t last more than #num #num an hour
it discharges too quickly
kind of annoying but i still love the laptop
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space
the only downfall is the volume control
the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn t work in real time
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute
i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since
i love it so much
it has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down
it s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box
great investment
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email
i had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town
the price and features more than met my needs
i love windows #num which is a vast improvment over vista
the feature are good enough for what i need
i love my macbook pro
i have been a mac user since the mid #num s
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense
my laptop is almost #num yrs old and i have never had any problems with it
if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it
it may take a little getting used to but you don t have to worry about viruses or other headaches
not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs
i am addicted to photo booth
it is so much fun to play with
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there
i am able to organize my pics music and files easily
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac
since i keyboard over #num wpm i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard no keys sticking or lagging strange configuration of extra key etc
i love the keyboard
most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on
this unit is not
the display is awesome
the resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read write drive
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers
i think this computer is super lame
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing
i went to my local best buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it
it doesnt work worth a damn
the display is beyond horrible
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time
there are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls
not to mention it has shit gigs
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop
i bought this last week and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch mouse stopped responding
got another #num and same issue
i am taking back today
don t waste your money or time
very dissappointed becase i have had toshibas for years and never a issue
stopped booting up less than a week after my one year warranty was up
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it
summary after doing some investigation on the web i have found that toshiba nb #num s are not chronically not booting
apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem
when i called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me #num for the phone call even though they didn t offer any technical support
i loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening
but if you can t make your product last more than a year you will not get my business again
i ve had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it
in those three years i ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan
after a couple of years my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company wide recall of my particular battery
in the three years i ve had my macbook pro i have never had a virus on my computer and i do a lot of work on the internet
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i ve used
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product
i highly recommend this product
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops but the ease of use security and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag
needs constant repair
first the screen goes completely out
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect
now the screen is going darker darker darker
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing
oh yeah don t forget the expensive shipping to and from hp
i v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand
so far so good with this laptop
fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature
screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive
memory is upgradable
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys
they click
sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money
i have owned many computers and laptops
i hate this one
vista is a nightmare
no tutorials on the display
the book is useless
the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv
this is one of the reasons i purchased it
thinking about returning it
the macbook is a fantastic laptop
this is the first macbook i have ever had
i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance
although the price is higher then dell laptops the macbooks are worth the dough
you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot
it just works flawlessly
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action
dells are ok hps aren t that good but macs or fantastic
i honestly love my mac thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised
i wasn t a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed
it had the full sized touch pad with #num buttons instead of just one
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate
keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel
this system came loaded with windows #num starter
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer
so far so good
when i got this laptop in #num to help me with school i had a hard time from beginning
i feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it
quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned
i have had several machines over the years both for personal and business use
all of them were windows machines
don t get me wrong i am no microsoft hater i ve just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine
for me five stars is not enough
i love the #num macbook pro
my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift and i m totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it
it was very easy to just pick up and use
it did not take long to get used to the mac os
i had been a windows linux user before this
i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable
there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto video editing or movie making imovie etc
the built in webcam is great for skype and similar video chat services
itunes is a handy music management program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons
all in all i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone
i ve always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what it s all about
i love it
i m so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc
they definitely have a superior product
its not just slow on the internet its slow in general
no i am generous calling it slow
its more like a snail crawl
i bought for my son in the #num nd grade
he can t stand it
i can t begin to say how disappointed i am
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer
the key bindings take a little getting used to but have loved the macbook pro
delivery was early too
it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more
with awesome graphics and assuring security it s perfect
the difference in the apple keyboard from a pc s keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to but overall it s worth it
i d recommend this laptop to anyone
the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty
it has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy
it is easy to navigate and update programs
my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them de bugged
i ve never had problems with viruses
my next laptop will also be a mac
i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac
i work in film editing and post production so i need a laptop that not only has power but memory and speed as well
my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit
the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer which is also a mac
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could
in my line of work i often have to take work home and this makes it so easy
i do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well
the apple care has never failed me and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well
i will only buy apple laptops from now on
great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great
my macbook pro has been a huge disappointment
from the build quality to the performance everything about it has been sub par from what i would have expected from apple
the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly
i would not recommend this product to anyone
screen is awesome battery life is good
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints
good laptop for the money
speakers don t get that loud but good enough
i can t imagine ever buying a pc again
i have had a mac for #num years and won t go back to pc
they don t crash
if a website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit
never been hacked
no viruses
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense
its also fun to use
the programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit
she said its very user friendly
i have had another mac but it got slow due to an older operating system
however i love this particular mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad
i am very happy i bought this mac well worth the extra money
i simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti virus
i got my macbook pro because i wanted to do all the stuff i need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more
i run dreamweaver final cut pro #num photoshop safari firefox msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing
i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door
take the simple easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around
i ve had my macbook pro since august #num
prior to this computer i owned a powerbook g #num for #num years quite a long time for a laptop
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought
my macbook pro is no exception
on my powerbook g #num i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i didn t like the trackpad
since i ve had this computer i ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad
the display is incredibly bright much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing spreadsheets and presentations similar to microsoft office
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well
i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality
shiny
this laptop is the best of the best
the awesomest of the awesomest
it is so great i can hardly ever take my hands off it
my friends are in awe every time they come over
i got it for christmas and i was so excited to set it up
it is super fast and always loads
i am just amazed
the only bad part is the size weight
it s like #num punds but if you can look past it it s great
if you don t like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you
it super shiny so you can see the fingerprints easily
it doesn t bother me though
it doesn t heat up like my old laptop
all for such a great price
it s color is even cool
another great thing is the beast graphics
they are so realistic i am just speechless
i let my friend borrow it and she knows nothing about computers and she used it with ease
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it
mom dad brother sister you name it
i don t know how i could ever live without my qousmio
i own a hewlett packard laptop and i ve had man problems with it since i bought in in feb #num
ive had to call tech support many times
each time taking about #num day or so
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair
i had to wait #num weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly
i had to pay for the shipping
i will never buy anything from hp again
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day
this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke
but after i got used to it i love it
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming
it has #num usb ports #num sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive
i would never go back any more i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone
i use my mac all the time i love the software the way it takes a short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you don t have to worry about viruses
with a mac you don t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall it s so wonderful
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny
all apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed
this computer will last you at least #num years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic
everything about a mac is wonderful it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it
not working bad
i spent #num dollars on a top of the line laptop
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it
#num payed #num for a premium laptop
#num blue screen first month
#num horrible customer support they lost my laptop for a month got it back #num months later
#num laptop still did not work blue screen within a week
#num cut my losses and sold it for parts
do yourself a favor this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one
i m new just switched from years of pc frustration
what an elegant wonderful machine
i m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way and apple does indeed have the better idea
i really wish i had done this years ago
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now it s a snap
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software you guys were great too
i love it never had a computer i was so impressed with and i ve had a lot of laptops and desktops this one is far and above the best one i ever had before
i tell everyone that i know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used
the computer blinks it shuts off at will
the letter a stopped working after the first week
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is #num twenty three days from the date of purchase
not the day received
so the fact that the computer does not work on the #num twenty fourth day is my fault
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem
they have not sent a new one nor called
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand
then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to
its sad because their commercials are great
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it
#num weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands
i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied
the only problems are the sound isnt very loud i have to wear headphones
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed #num to send it in to fix it
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay #num to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the #num and it was fixed
it took a little over #num weeks until i got it back
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk
the graphics are great
the internet speed is spectacular
the battery life is probably an hour at best
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again
this computer doesn t do that well with certain games it can t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is #num for two cds
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop
i bought a hp pavilion dv #num #num nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer
the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer
also i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot
when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself
also the battery does not last very long at all
i would recommend not buying this product
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem
i am stuck with a laptop that i cannot do very much with
also i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly
also i have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines
it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer
will probably never buy a hp again
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace
before we got this laptop had a compaq pasaro for #num years with no problems
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq
i hate it
i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning #num of these laptops
the first fell apart right after the #num year warranty
during that time i had to send it back #num times
i paid about #num for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing
they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem
the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about #num for the extended warranty
i sent it back and they lost it
i waited and waited and no laptop
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box
i waited another month for approval and for them to build me a new laptop
i was psyched
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn t go onto our wireless network and i wouldn t have the same problems because it was updated
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing
hp didn t fix it
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one
i use my friends and family s #num laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp well i ll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone
bought notebook #num #num
in #num months the connect quality got worse and worse
#num st time they got it working the next #num month they had me send it in
returned it
#num months dead again
they say sorry out of warranty
summary they played games with me for the warranty period
now #num months later they want would not say exact amount #num #num to #num to fix the machine
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything
now the machine won t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for #num days and now i m out of warranty even though this has been a constant #num month occurance since i bought the netbook
so buyer beware when buying toshiba
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market
i also bought one for my wife and #num for my office
they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat
i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than #num second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there
i had to call apple #num times each time #num to #num minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics #num times
this is what they told me it heats up and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops and simply categorize them as portables
you might think i am new in this game but i am a gadget lover and have had more than #num dozens laptops in the past #num years and none gets this hot that fast
i also experience the same with my macbook air
so you might ask what did apple do for me
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened #num months ago they offered me an itouch #num gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby
the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times
sad very sad
i had meant to purchase the nb #num and bought this one by accident long story
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone
so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message
i have had the netbook for #num months and i love it i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use
also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook
would highly recommend this netbook though
i paid for extra memory and the #num inch screen as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date
the leather carrying case keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork
my laptop cost approximately #num #num and died after only #num years #num months and #num days of use
although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim
accordingly i have decided to never purchase another hp product my five year old compaq lasted #num years before the hard drive crashed
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the #num inch macbook pro
the quality engineering design and warranty are superior covers damage from dropping the laptop
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note
this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only #num months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal
the repairs were made quickly though i must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me
unable to boot up this brand new laptop
spent #num hours on phone with hp technical support
they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after #num hours on phone could not fix it
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed
small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips
the perfect notebook
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port
called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting
no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity
needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless
with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone
i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion
summary i ve had this laptop for #num months out of the blue the power adapter stops working
call tech support standard email the form and fax it back in to us
i called back to ensure that received it they had
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back #num days later to be told that it takes #num #num days for turnaround time
this was the #num rd day and part still had not been shipped
asked the customer service rep
if it s not shipped on the next business day called on a friday they are closed on weekends what was the next step
the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site
i m tired of the inept service
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small
i m really frustrated by this experience
how does the power supply not work
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter so it s not just an isolated incident
our apple #num #num macbook pro notebook computer z #num j #num notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking
i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv
it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products
it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better
so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple #num #num macbook pro notebook computer z #num j #num notebook for all your needs
it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated but once you get past the initial expense you ll find that they re worth every penny besides there s always the financing plan that best buy offers
the #num macbook pro is portable durable and very capable
it has a #num hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over #num hours
it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a #num watt lightbulb
it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics
it s also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multi touch track pad is amazing
typically when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience
however the multi touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work
they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv #num in nov of #num
bought with a credit card
probbly the worst decision we ever made
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive #num times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway #num times they would give us a new one
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
first it does not have a push button to open the lid
it is held in place magnetically
there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that
once open the leading edge is razor sharp
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design
using this machine is like a mild form of torture
in the shop these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it get it home break the seal and use it very clever con
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening
also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it
i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use
buy this if you like being tortured teased frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac
it s a bummer and one out of five is being kind
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary
i m going to try and keep my old g #num on the road for as long as possible
in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used #num different laptops in the past #num years i find not much difference except of course for the screen size
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing
i like this machine because its very lightweight
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent
#num hours of battery life is really something else
i highly recommend that you buy this product
i ve owned every pro model apple laptop for the last #num years this is by far the worst one i ve ever had
it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like a pc maybe worse and i loose all my open documents
i hate it
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them
i saw this one and i have the most difficult time trying to use them they ve made great dust collectors i hate putting this computer down
i love it
i can t say enough good for it
it s a mac
i fine apple mc #num ll a #num #num ghz #num macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go
i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races
it s face and depanable
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art
it s just a great toy to have around
very very slow laptop
tons of bloatware and junk programs
can t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small
amazing machine
it is a big big but since it has a #num #num screen what would you expect
it is truly a desktop replacement
very fast and efficient
does a great job with video shot on a canon #num d mkii
very happy with my #num th toshiba laptop
the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again
the computer loads in about a #num #num th of the time that my pc did and i have all of the programs that were on my pc
of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too
i m hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows #num on it by using the vmware program
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac
i also got the added bonus of a #num hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh
i never have had a good result with this computer
i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what i ve done
the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord
they told me to reprogram the computer and i didn t need to do that and i lost pictures of my oldests first #num years of her life
i don t like this company nor the toshiba brand and i ll never buy another one because i ve put more into it then it is worth
i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a toshiba that isn t good at all
i just bought this laptop #num days ago
the right speaker did not work
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one
again the same problem the right speaker did not work
i returned the #num nd laptop for a full refund
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move
the mouse buttons are hard to push
i cant believe hp put this out
do not buy you will be disappointed
i m returning mine
dell is a decently made pc
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro #num to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop
i love hp it s the only computer printer we will buy
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college
this is perfect for her field
at first when i got this product i loved it
the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems
then within #num months the charger crapped out on me
so i called compaq and after being on the phone for #num hours i finally got a replacement which i shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty
#num months later the battery went
they gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it didn t die
then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went
i had to pay #num for a universal charger for this cheap #num laptop
not worth it one bit
the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory
also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after #num months the screen split in half just from everyday use
apparently under the screen there are #num little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose
and it is impossible to get them back in
strengths well shaped
weaknesses a bad videocard
posted nov #num #num
two weeks ago i bought this notebook
what can i say
the first programm i switched on was a game for my children
after #num #num min the screen of the notebook switched off
it was still working but there was nothing on the screen
i was said it s videocard
very disappointed
didn t expect to repair it at once
going to bring it to service today
don t buy this model
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will
i just can t fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products it only survives b c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question raising programs
mine came at #num #num w o a dvd burner
enough said
the screen is framed by half to a full inch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk
the #num usb ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then
keyboard could use some trimming
did i mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk
i m glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac
the benefits were immediate
awesome graphics
applications respond immediately not like the tired ms applications
i can actually get work done with this mac and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop
the magnetic plug in power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation
the apple applications ex iphoto are fun easy and really cool to use unlike the competition
after doing cad work all day at work using a higher end pc i couldn t come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer
this laptop rocks only wish it could run solidworks cad which apple doesn t support
i ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far using my new macbook pro
i am definitely sold and not going back to pcs for home use
i previously owned an hp desktop and a dell laptop
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them
i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it
i especially like the backlit keyboard
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier
it is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy
the graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid
the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver much easier than any other computer i have ever owned
i use iphoto all the time which is a great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike
the program came with the computer and works beautifully
i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails
my hp g #num #num dx died after only #num months
it started out getting hot after only a few months
i should have sent it back to them then
at #num months it started shutting off after only #num or #num minutes
i use a cooling pad but it doesn t help
i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it
i had a toshiba for #num years
i ll stick to tashiba
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro
it fires up in the morning in less than #num seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest
this is now my #num rd macbook pro and i really honestly love it
the newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick but it is still a great notebook
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile
i love it
i even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like ichat photobooth garage band and more
we are addicted to the mac
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it
great laptop that offers many great features
lightweight and the screen is beautiful
i have had my new macbook pro i #num for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc laptops
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops
before i bought my new i #num i did my research for about #num weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability dependable and long lasting operations
buy it love it and i promise you won t regret it
this computer is good for #num days then it sucks for the rest of your life
don t waste their money save it and but a mac
you will regret it if you buy any dell
dell sucks
the only pro to this computer is it was under #num
everything is falling apart internally and externally
i am not much of a computer techie so i can understand some of the internal problems though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program
with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection or the page can t be displayed
it takes me approximately #num tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works
i have vista so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs
i can t even install one of the #num printers i have in my house so i am unable to print
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has a terrible glare
in short i would never buy a compaq again
my last computer a toshiba cost only #num and worked like a charm for many years
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc
i love the mac so much better than my work pc
i will never go back to windows
never any doubt i would get a macbook just wasn t sure which one
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook
the performance is awesome
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar
with all the goodies inside this machine it is a value
it is very well built
the keyboard is top notch
the touch pad is among the best
the screen is huge and coloful but no led backlighting
the video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not a gamers first choice
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable
it had a cooling system malfunction after #num minutes of general use and would not move past this error
i realize that not every unit has this issue but the ones that do cannot be repaired
i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card but still requires a return
instead of taking another chance on toshiba i went with an asus g #num jh x #num
they offer the best warranty in the business and don t #num rd party it out like toshiba
for the same price you get a lot more in the asus #num x #num res awesome cooling system much better grafics card ati #num #num gb ram led backlit screen
sorry toshiba but #num st impressions do count for something
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing
but to be honest i don t use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming
so this was great for me
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it
i look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space
it s super fast and a great value for the price
i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one
no complaints with their desktop and maybe because it just sits on your desktop and you don t carry it around which could jar the hard drive or the motherboard
bought this gateway m #num or #num early #num
a month later we reinstall the os vista
a coupla months later they change my hard drive
a month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died
went silently
one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day i turn it on no gui screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does
the motherboard is dead
and i m still paying the bloody financing for a product which didn t last me at least three years
i initially purchased my macbook pro #num in april and i loved it
i had never owned a mac before
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive
i was so happy with my new mac
for #num months
then the hard drive failed
my information was all lost my fault i know but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac the paragon of all computers
so after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another #num months of my new computer until it froze this morning completely
i can t even turn it off
it s catatonic
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it s like new i might have #num months next time
oh boy
i would rate this computer at #num stars but considering it has a short life span i can only give it #num and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine
i m going back to pc
at least those computers didn t just die on me like this one
great battery speed display
it works
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac
as it turns out i just didn t know any better
my house is now #num macbook
the macbook starts fast doesn t crash has a fantastic display is small and light i have the #num #num model and isn t always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc
this is what a laptop is supposed to be
i thought the price was great for the specs
but after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor
i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it
the keyboard is too slick
i really don t like it but i am stuck
dell latitude d #num is not a reliable machine
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely
this is the first apple product that i have purchased
very disappointing
i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash
about #num #num of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash
web access through the #num g network is so slow it s very frustrating and very disappointing
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers
after purchasing this thing i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line
i go to purchase it on line and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later
i now realize that my #num would have been better spent on a windows laptop
hp pavilion dv #num notebook pc when i first got this computer it really rocked
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing on line through wi fi
eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on
hp said it was out of warranty
guess i ll stay away from hp
my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me but i have just been using firefox instead
if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer
i love this computer
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere but still has a big enough screen to get everything done
everything is so easy to use mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software
the only thing that i don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to
games being the main issue
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can t play it because its not compatable with the software
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be
other than that i don t have one complaint in the world
this computer periodically crashes office iphoto safari
it takes a long time to get on the web and to change web sites
locks up she searching for updates
just to be clear
i have been an apple user since they switched to intel
i have had macbook pros and macbook airs and have never had a problem
it seems that this computer might be a lemon
i purchased it through amazon
i have had one complaint into the supplier but got little support
i am taking the computer to apple to see what they think
i purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since i had a student discount but i would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if i had too
the retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well
but if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile
count me as extremely satisfied it s a perfect computer
i just bought this computer from the apple store and i couldn t be more impressed with it
it has a stunning retina display and is very fast
the solid state memory makes it a lot faster than previous macbook pro models that used a spinning hard drive
this computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations
also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth
the hd display is sensational and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me
no hardware issues as is common with any apple product
great product and couldn t be happier with it
awesome laptop i love it
i love my new thinkpad
it gives me everything i need from a computer and with the long lasting battery it also gives me mobility
i can use it anywhere
it was a great purchase
all the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a thinkpad
average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly
below average on the w fi adapter which i m still trying to get to the bottom of
if the wi fi adapter will not support duplex operation still trying to get to the bottom of that that s a noticeable drawback i ll be grousing about for the entire time i use it
great laptop
fast
works very well
would purchase again
a good value for the money
quite pleased with it
fast enough for my purposes
no bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall
excellent keyboard and crisp screen
battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of ram so that is a trade off i suppose
i m glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days
the laptop itself is very good it could be better but not bad at all for it s price point
it does everything i need
the big deal with this was windows #num
i had searched everywhere for a windows #num laptop and all i could find was that awful windows #num
when i saw this i grabbed it
it has met all my needs
just what i expected
i don t have any complains about this computer
outstanding laptop and very well built
this unit will replace my old desktop
the retina display is fantastic
one of the best thing i have bought in years
great pc light and powerful
is just amazing
the glare of the glossy retina display is unbearable
do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved
performs as advertised if not better
super light weight i never cared either way about weight until now
feels like solid state
wonderful machine
glad i bought it
tiny forgivable drawback no ethernet cable outlet
but that s not a deal breaker
super laptop
will probably get another one for my wife
a bit ugly but works good
i like the design rather sleek and light
i will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop its good for web browsing and word processing
fantastic for the price just wish it the keys were illuminated
if your on a budget save up longer
this laptop isn t worth a single cent
i couldn t even install linux on it
windows runs very poorly
just save your money and get something better
awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than #num hours without recharging
are u serious
awesome
this laptop is a complete cheap junk
by just looking at it you will realize it s crap
it s not what you pay for
the case is made from cheap plastic
in the description it said there is bluetooth but no there isn t
i m warning you you re wasting your money on this
love the computer
hate windows #num #num
it dosn t even have a disc compartment
had to return the computer
keeps freezing
no ethernet outlet
disc drive will not open or function
odd unusual dell commands
would have exchanged instantly but had to use as if for college immediately
unimpressed
terrific laptop
works beautifully
great price
just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class
this is a great home computer
it is very very quiet
the only reason i didn t give it a #num star is i feel i have to reach so far to type on the key board
you also have to press firmly on the keys
otherwise this is a great computer great prices
was easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it
works good and is fast enough for me
good product for a good price
it was too cheaply constructed
it also gave me an introduction to windows #num which i hope will be discontinued it the future
the computer is horrible its to slow
the thing that you insert cds into won t open
i won t ever buy a computer off amazon again that s for sure
not a good computer at all
we returned two days later
they were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day
thank you
great price and computer
i bought this laptop computer for my parents they only access their facebook and e mail accounts see family pictures etc
they loved it
it s easy to operate and it s very light my parents are almost #num yo they can t carry a heavy computer while traveling
but here s something i hadn t realized before buying it there isn t an optical drive which means no cds or dvds
this product was doa
fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test
would not recommend
pretty good laptop
good for basic stuff
don t try to use to play any pc games or anything
just for simple web browsing and media streaming
pretty premium feel for the low price
i have so much trouble turning the computer on
it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off
my mistake was to not research this one no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures
i was in a big hurry to buy a computer just to produce a newsletter for my job
i should have waited to find a higher quality computer
i m very happy this laptop is beatifull is nt slow at all
but it doesn t have a cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting
just wifi
the screen is big and everything was as described
for everyday use you can t really go wrong with this laptop
if like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line then this is a winner
if you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else
it s a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet
like i said good for basic stuff and as a starter
still getting use to window #num
has a built in camera which i do not use
sturdy but only for typical wear and tear
can not believe the price
amazing computer perfect for school
i ve had my lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more
i really have nothing negative to say about it
the keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the function button to get the f keys but with how infrequently i use those it is a non issue
it is a great value for what you get
i can run somewhat modern games like skyrim and fallout new vegas with no issues
i get giddy every time i use this thing
it is a thing of beauty and fast enough
what s fast enough
when you click and don t wait
waiting is horrible and not waiting is the best thing on earth
so yes it is ridiculously fast
the battery will get you from la to ny no problem
the #num #num way different than my other computer so we have to get use to it
it is very light and the picture is nice and the price was amazing
can even readmy kindle on this computer
excellent item shipped on time met my expectations it doesnt heat at all dont use it for gaming
for the price this is a super product out of the box
it wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at #num
plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard
no junkware
this computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life banling facebook etc and some basic offline work using ms office
the only drawback is no dvd player but for #num you can buy an external one
very light and beautiful
it s just a little slow
five starts
terribly slow
start up time took forever everything runs very slowly
screen broke #num month outside warranty
overall build quality is cheap
avoid acer
not bad
nice and light seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself
perfect size for me
probably not a gaming machine which i have zero interest in
i just love this ultrabook
i defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work
it s ok
i find that it often gets very slow and i have to restart more than usual
it s light and easy to use though
i love this computer this is my first ever mac i m #num and it took a little while to switch over from the os i was used to but it was a fast learning curve
the resolution is gorgeous the computer is light it does everything i need and the interface is pretty intuitive
i love this computer
however i am very upset that it doesn t have the superdrive built in
supper east to use
retina display is beautiful
also very quick laptop
con hate that it has no disk drive
beautifully done the computer is amazingly faster compared to other version of macbook pro i have had in the past
i am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time
the battery life is good even with using high profile software like sibelius #num for a good half of the day
overall the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price which make this apple purchase a worthwhile one
wonderful super fast lightweight computer
the new macbook pro working good user experience fast speed faster start up time
this is what i was looking for
it has a wide screen and it s easy to use
at my age i need this kind of laptop
extremely slow
a masterpiece of crap
not durable
slow processor just not it
i upgraded the memory from #num gb to #num gb and found the user manual which i read while awaiting the laptop to arrive more useful than the youtube demo
i can t use the trackpad very well it s too sensitive so i hooked up a mouse
external monitor worked easily
been using lenovo thinkpad edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them
they have held up well not just in our sales department but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust exhaust grease oil and all manner of other non computer friendly substances
general a quality laptop
the lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you re not interested in it
windows #num rocks
computer runs very slow
great laptop
bigger screen than expected laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage including programming editing
one of the very few laptops still available with win #num pro multiple usb ports and a dvd read write drive
only drawback is no led to show when the hard drive is being accessed
not a necessity but something i ve come to expect
does what i need it to do and the price was right
great laptop from apple
apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality
the retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date
the pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface
battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display
i can easily get #num hours out of a full charge
also i find os x much more simple and easy to use than windows
overall a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer
well worth the extra cost
as a long time pc user i nearly done using pcs
size is perfect and display is beautiful
get speck cover at the same time
excellent performance especially given its price point
it s performing very well after a week s use and i don t anticipate any trouble given my past experiences with dell pcs
the screen is wide and provides excellent clarity
in addition to some usage on the road this is also my desktop unit
it is not a small compact laptop but i won t be traveling via air often so its size and weight is not a problem for me
this was recommended to me by an it support specialist in the local school district
i can appreciate why she recommended it
if you are undecided between a desktop or laptop pc i strongly recommend this pc as a solution
don t expect much in terms of performance from this laptop
it gets the job done in terms of having a computer that can browse the web use word excel and the like
this laptop does not have an rj #num ethernet adapter for wired network connection
fast easy
i live in jamaica and bought this online and my husband took it down for me
so far i do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor
my son saw this laptop online and told be about it and i thought it was a good deal and bought it
i have had it over a month now and it works just fine
this laptop suits my needs as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose
my daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us
so i gave this #num stars but only because of the poor picture quality other than that it is a great buy
this laptop is absolutely horrible
i bought it simply for excel on windows for work since i have a macbook air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening excel or my web browser
there is a chance mine is defective but regardless i m not going to try another one this is a terrible product
i d much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for #num
i appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing dell but just not worth it
it is slow and complicated and very disappointing
great labtop
not as fast as i would have liked it to be but everything else is great
i ve only had this computer for a few days an i already don t like it
the battery life is a joke and it s causing other problems
i will be returning it
if people are writing bad reviews about this laptop then believe what they say
this is an ok computer
the processor shows a speed of #num #num gz
the sound is disappointing
no bass sound at all
maybe this one is just a dud
the computer is very wonderful
was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it
it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw but over all im very satisfied
its very fast and very light
great product
i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing
i absolutely love my dell inspiron
i use it for basic web browsing and word processing
i have also used it to watch youtube and hulu
it powers on off very quickly and it loads up automatically
the mouse click is a bit loud but it really isn t a problem
for #num i highly recommend
very poor quality lap top
i am returning it
slow
great value laptop
i can t believe this was just #num
i am using primarily for office and outlook while i m on the road
speed is great easy to set up and get going
very pleased so far
it is very difficult to use this computer
too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up
this things run smoothly for its price and the battery life seems to go on forever
i got this laptop as an upgrade replacement for my old lenovo notebook
i didn t have that much money so i thought i d give the inspiron a try
i wasn t disappointed in its performance
all in all it s well worth its price tag
great laptop for the price
it was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had a a side keyboard
i do a lot of #num key so i can t be pecking around at the top looking for numbers
b a dvd cd player
i have a lot of antiquated programs that i use that require a download
c a large hard drive instead of using the cloud
d was under #num with shipping
the only con is windows effin #num
still giving it a #num star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen
great for web design and general work
overall good but processing power isn t very good
w #num pro with w #num pro upgrade is nice but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there
i replaced stock drive with wd black #num k drive and is still quite slow
battery doesn t last long web browsing #num #num hours maybe
it has some bloat wear that i wish weren t there
it works fine for a pc in this price range
i bought it for my parents late #num s and they love it particularly the keyboard and screen
terrific value for the money
love the key layout and the built in mouse pad all work well and are properly sized
was easy to get up and running and comes with windows #num pro my favorite operating system so far do not like windows #num
highly recommended
works good but doesn t seem like it s made sturdy
kinda to light and plastic feeling
i have square trade for it just in case it breaks
killer computer
replaced a #num year old hp that never gave us a lick of trouble
i would highly recommend this computer it is fast
doesn t have touch screen but i have a tablet so that wasn t so important
look and feel is good
i am experiencing the system little slower than what i have expected
and processor feels pressured even though i run medium scale programs watching the way exhaust speed increases
the hdd has a scratching noise
the system sometimes lags a lot
i don t like it at all
i can t put a protector to make presentation
a good value on a quality product
easy setup and delivers all the functions we need
this laptop is amazing
despite the fact that there s no optical drive everything is perfect
the screen resolution is crystal clear the speakers are amazing and the track pad is easy to use
the home page startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing i was mainly concerned about
internet is fast and reliable battery life lasts a long time
i love this laptop
looks like this dell is a piece of crap
it does not turn on if i take the battery out it might work not sure if it s a bad battery or computer
do not recommend
awesome laptop
standard issue for company road warriors where i work
bootup time is amazing battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor
fantastic machine i have never believed the hype behind apple products but must admit i am now a mac user and do not see myself going back
there is somewhat of a learning curve but the operating system and hardware of this mac are great
more than enough for my use
the display is vibrant and clear the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on
i even installed a windows partition to be able to run windows software
things just work they are fluid easy to use and understand fast and work well
this computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing watching video word processing and that s about it
if you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video this computer is not for you
now when i say don t expect to play games on it i mean it
pretty much every major game save for solitare won t even play on it due to the slower processor
its also worth noting that there no bluetooth no mircophone jack no ethernet no dvd cd drive burner and no usb #num #num ports
it does come with two usb #num #num ports a hdmi port and a webcam
the webcam is nothing special its there if you need it
don t expect it to take good pictures or video
the battery is pretty soild
it lasts up to #num #num hours with normal use
the computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch
the only major negative to me is windows #num #num though ymmv and the dell crapware installed
i would strongly recommend to remove it and install windows #num on it with a usb drive
the performance will improve on it
trust me
not bad for the price
i needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine
performance wise it s a bit slow but that s to be expected from a celeron class processor
i m also not a fan of windows #num but fortunately i can install whatever i want on the laptop without issue
love everything about this laptop
sound quality and touchscreen are awesome
i would definitely recommend this
i love this laptop to the moon
my favorite colors black and red the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard
the sound is great and it s fast
i had a number of updates to do and customization
the laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard
the touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi fast
microsoft office is a #num day trial a number of games and apps are already preloaded
it s exactly like the picture and i am satisfied
great laptop light and very versatile
it was easy to set up
i like the number pad for work so that s nice
this is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptop so far so good after a month
it took some getting used to on the widows #num #num after being an xp user for many years
everything seems to be running smoothly
only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software
they are fine while the free subscription is going but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login
device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat
it has a quick start up and shut down time
the display is good quality
just wish there were more usb ports
i am impressed with this computer inexpensive but quality
love the size i am using this for work i am a nurse and have to chart daily this is easy to use and i have not had any problems with it
it s so damn good i bought #num d
if you re the type of person that just likes to browse the internet and enjoy media and do light work with microsoft office this is the laptop for you
don t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you
it s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag
i would recommend this to anyone who doesn t need much out of a computer
bought a spare one for college and one for my mom d
happy shopping guys
i am very happy with this computer
it is exactly what i expected and the price is excellent
you are getting what you pay for and in my opinion it is worth more
been using it for about #num hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything i need it to do
its a very basic laptop
i thought it would have a cd rom drive but there isnt one
also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work
but for the price its good
other than the slow cpu it works great for everyday use
heavy gaming is definitely not it s strong point
the cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction
slick design and looks great
the machine is easy to use has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work
it could be lighter but couldn t everything
the battery seems adequate for most uses #num #num hour use charge
screen is clear and bright
glad it has the dvd drive
perfectly adequate
great pc
the i #num is incredibly fast the ram makes it proper for several games not on maximum quality
great sound quality too
nice laptop
i use it for school its quick and has everything i need on it
good battery life as well
wifi card not working right out of the box
dealing with hp support is a ridiculous and painful experience
i have spent more than #num #num hours on the phone with them over #num different calls only to get no where
now i m looking into the return process which i m sure will just be loads of fun if my prior experience is any indication
seriously save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company
used to love hp products but this has soured me on the whole company
by far the best laptop i ve ever had
its fast powerful screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size
my only concern is that since the battery is not external i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time
i wonder if thats just apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop #num #num years from now lol
the product is average and works well
works at a decent speed
the mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars
i had a great experience purchasing my dell inspiron i #num #num bk #num #num inch laptop
i was very impressed by the sellers speedy two day delivery which was free
my laptop was easy to set up and i ve had no problems to date
thank you
did not disappoint me at all
lenovo is the best laptop
built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose
and the only microphone input is for a combo mike speaker plug
so to communicate i need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a built in mike
that s a nuisance for family skype calls only one can speak at a time
we haven t used it enough or had it long enough to give it #num stars but so far it has been a very good laptop
several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now i can understand why this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we ve ever owned
i m a life long desktop computer user and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a normal keyboard as i ve ever seen
we like this new laptop a lot
very good performer for the price
not blazing fast but quick enough
one really nice thing about lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software
the desktop was clean once i got it up and running
battery life is above average and it charges quickly
keyboard is sturdy
the touch pad takes a little getting used to as the click buttons are on top instead of the bottom
i will be considering lenovo for all future laptop purchases
this lap top is good so far
it is quiet runs smoothly
i really like the video option on it i stream movies on amazon prime and netflix and there is no lag
actually streams better than my regular desk top computer
the only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops i think
now i lay a pillow on my lap first
problem solved
ouch
it stopped working #num days after purchase
i just tried to restart it
i hope they can fix it somehow
it was slow and might be problematic
i would shop around for a better one
crashed only #num days from getting it
says it is failing hard drive
going to see what lenovo does
i should have bought something better
the pc is works well with a good battery and a power cable and has a web cam
however it does not have a dvd drive neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external dvd drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive
got it for my wife
other than a hate of windows #num she just loves it
this is not my first dell laptop
i ve owned other models as well
this one doesn t seem to be the same quality as ones i have purchased before
the plastic materials are rather cheap
love it
needs more instructions with it
i m very happy with my acer it does just for what i need it
even the sound is fantastic
i love this laptop
even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design
although i ve had it for less than a week i am very satisfied
functions well
does all that was advertised
if it had a #num #num star option that is what i would give
the build is perfect the screen fantastic but i do have a bit of a problem with the fact that i have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect
i just bought this laptop yesterday
this is how i feel about the laptop so far
#num great display
love the color accuracy
#num very decent speakers
#num fairly fast
#num loud fan when watching #num k video off youtube
sounds like a washer
machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen
#num best to use the power supply for #num k video viewing
battery power laptop had difficulties computing
#num still feels too heavy to me
could lose another pound or two
#num expensive
paid close to #num out the door
there are too many things to test
will update my review when i have time
biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased
bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a dell in the past which was a great computer
this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered
it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for #num minutes
i promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine
the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge
and i have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them
what a lemon
this is a big disappointment
i only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that
it takes a long time to load any page
i ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely #num times
had to call dell to get it back online
i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop
never again
i ve always sworn by dell
my very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me
it was stubborn as hell no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it
it worked super fast and got the job done
so with this new order all the upgrades and windows #num really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul
i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow
all i needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there
i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load
i know its not my internet connection because i have an hp as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info i have on it
i m so disappointed
disclaimer i m a mac user
i wanted to love this laptop which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs before my new university gave me one
in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces
in addition no matter what i do to change the settings add delete flash etc firefox hangs on start up
it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on
the cords always feel like they are in my way
one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual
it s a pleasure to type on
my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away
if you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it
it s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down
if you have zero dollars consider it
if you want ease of use and long term happiness buy a macbook
great for games
it s truly a great laptop for the price
i built my own gaming pc with a intel i #num #num in it and a gtx #num so i know what crazy performance on a computer can come to
however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years
for #num which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value
it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me
i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well
but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards
if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on medium low settings but i certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming
overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web browsing
would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant
this computer is very slow
i love this laptop
it does everything i need it too
very good price
very nice computer
immediately didn t like the track buttons
they are loud and clunky but i figured i d get used to it
no need to
the laptop died two days after i received it
i purchased a dell inspiron i #num #num bk and so far i love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks
if you re looking for a basic pc this is the way to go
the hinges on this pc are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the pc
i was surprised at the overall quality and the price
in all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless
i just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks
it took almost #num minutes to boot up
please people dont make the same mistake i did
this is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you
would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly
it was not responsive at all to touch
very frustrating
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse
if they can fix this i think it would be a very nice cost effective laptop
this laptop broke within the first hour of use
the a key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in
dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes
also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises
i m sure i just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one
this laptop is nice
it has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough
the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive
so frustrating
i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped
also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad
i would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand
no lenovo for me
initially i liked the product so much
although it was slow but i felt it was ok for the price you have bought it
but now i am having battery problems
laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches #num
i bought this laptop in november #num
i am not satisfied with the product
it s an amazing laptop
most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad
the laptop is fast
the windows #num #num used to boot in just #num s and that was freaking awesome
now i have dual booted my laptop to windows #num #num and ubuntu #num #num and it s not got too slow either
i am loving it completely
it does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much
it doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage
but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying
i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else
hp please fix it
a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier
uhhhhhh the computer looks good
but it works really slowwwwww
it has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page
purchased it for my birthday and love it
i ve been a loyal dell user for quite some time
but every six months my dell computer crashes
since i also do a lot of writing and illustrations using adobe products i thought i would try a mac
i m so glad that i have
it s been a very easy transition moving my windows created files over to the mac
so far i haven t lost any quality or information
i have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts
but other than that i really am loving the quality and speed
expensive but worth it
the display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print
haven t quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall
i ll keep trying however
this is without a doubt the worst laptop i ve ever had
i wavered between another toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and i m so sorry i did
and of course the return window closed last week so now i m stuck with it
i will never buy another lenovo anything
unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop don t buy this
the touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i ve worked with have some inherent oddities
this one however is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own
today it hasn t worked at all more than it has
the laptop has #num g and a #num #num g processor and it s slower than the four year old toshiba i replaced
it hangs freezes and just isn t working properly
i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open
though i don t have much installed i only have #num of the #num g left
i have no idea what s taking up all the room it doesn t make sense
most of my things are stored in the cloud
i could go on and on but suffice it to say if you want to spend #num on a laptop don t buy this one
it s definitely not worth the money
very fast and good for most steam games
don t expect great graphics though
the keyboard and sound are great and the matte screen works well
can run cs go at #num fps on low settings
computer was doa
turned it on and it was beeping
looked up the manual on another computer
the manual said that particular series of beeps indicated a video problem
have the unit serviced
lenovo sent me a box to return it to them
they claim they will have it back in six working days
we ll see
once i get a working computer i think i will like it
i ve had lenovo computers before
i love this laptop
looks good well built and very good speed
needed a #num usb adapt for network plug no problem
keyboard is nice and windows #num #num is great worried about that coming from xp
price makes this the laptop i was looking for
so far i am very happy with this computer
it has everything i wanted built in wi fi connectibility a slot for my sd camera memory card a dvd burner big beautiful screen plenty of usb ports three #num #num and one #num #num and a keyboard with a nice touch
i liked the fact that it came with windows #num but also included windows #num to install later if i need it
the price was good
i use a wireless mouse but the touch pad and the red button in the middle that works like a little joystick also work fine
i wish i had bought this sooner
this is a great bargain
yes it s running and old type processor so hey don t even try gaming on it
but if you are just an average user it works really great
the screen is good the whole things is very light and doesn t run hot
i m very happy with it typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that
i like everything about this laptop
it has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that s all i use anyway
i put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm
i plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked no fuss no muss
it immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go
excellent buy
the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon
firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing
ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled
also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around #num kb sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around #num kb sec making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless
get a probook instead
too often i would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet
i was unable to download itunes to it
dell support was awful to deal with
and the settings are simply annoying
just not for me
the computer is as expected and worth the money
the #num #num windows is a major disappointment
operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain
was this computer refurbished
it came with no instruction book no back up cd s and has already crashed
help
hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far
the mid #num macbook pro does no disappoint
retina screen solid build quality weight fast processor and the reliability of the apple brand
cons honestly zero con s as a windows pc user the switch over was seamlessly i run parallel when i need windows
all my devices work flawlessly
i m an amature so this does more than i can handle
i m perfectly satisfied just have to get use to the new #num #num system i can t see a problem
i doi #num ng fine now and happy as a bug
the price is great and it does everything i want to do thanks
i bought this for my #num year old for a birthday gift
it s perfect
he uses to play mine craft and school work
it s great for what he uses it for
i am really not happy with this computer
the keyboard is not as easy to use as my old sony
i don t like windows #num but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar
would not buy it again
meh but cheap
i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering
the reviews at the time in late july #num were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost #num star review
the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus
now the graphics are not hd and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic
so if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine
now the speed is disappointing
start up is fine maybe #num secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times
even for a #num gb ram it barely chugs with #num tabs open
i tried all the window updates this worked for a couple of hp laptops i #num in that i bought later at bb to see if it could remove the drag it did not
really at this point i am trying to confirm if the ram can be upgraded to see if i can do that to help
couple that with lack of inbuilt bluetooth dvd drive you are looking at a close tie or even a loss compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late august #num
the hp laptops #num in with i #num core and amd i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram
but alas they were gifts and what is a gift if not given
all in all i wish i had waited a bit
but then again hindsight is #num #num
bought a usb dvd rw drive but have not used it yet
this laptop is amazing
windows #num #num has its pros and cons
the keyboard is backlit but you have to press the f #num key to turn it on
i was nervous at first that i purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard backlight
of course this will decrease your battery life
the sound is very nice and crisp
also i have no regrets about going with the #num gb ram because its super fast
i m still exploring the various features but overall i am satisfied with my purchase
the hp envy #num has been everything i expected
after doing much research for a laptop that had all the features i was looking for this one hit all the criteria i had
amazon had the best pricing and the delivery was on time
the laptop is very responsice with the core i #num processor and #num gb of ram and the sound out of the beats audio is great
i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop
used #num times black screen returned for refund
do not use the facial recognition
windows #num is not supported by a lot of things
save your money and get an android works better more support
the dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints
it does what it advertises
price is great wish it didn t have windows #num but that is an opinion
i would recommend it for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop
i bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework it s not a fast computer but it s great for what she needs it for and very light weight
love the price too
well my first apple computer and i am impressed
works well fast and no reboots
waiting to install ms office and see how it goes from there
have always been a pc guy but decided to try apple
glad i did so far
s l o w rea llllyy slow
like seriously really slow
impossible to use
cant even read properly
plus no russian input wtf
what a great laptop i can run my games and work really fast
really light you can carry with you everywhere
great battery life
everything at a very great price
i completely recommend it
excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a macbook
you can t get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive
all the newer macbooks do not
plus you get #num gb which is also a great feature
also the resale value on this will keep
i highly recommend you get one before they are gone
literally it stays much cooler than my old macbook pro
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while
got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn t be happier
the screen is great i don t see the need for a retina display
i also really like the addition of the sd card slot
this macbook pro is amazing
if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don t be
after not having a disc player i have actually noticed that i never used this disc play in my old laptop either
however if you really need a disc player apple sells one that connects to your usb port
i love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter
overall this is a fast light practical computer and i highly recommend it
i bought my macbook pro in october of #num and #num years later it still works as flawless as ever
i ve never had any problems with the computer itself the macbook charger chords are another story though
i tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon but you re just living in denial if you don t
i just bought #num rd gen ipad to add to my collection
happy buying
bought this laptop from best buy in january #num still loving it
i can use it as a tablet as a laptop as whatever i want to
i play sims #num and #num on it all the time with very little issues
the thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go
music videos sound great and look great
i use it everyday
my favorite computer i ve ever had
this computer overall is great
it runs fast
ships fast
etc but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck
i bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd
i could see the disk drive on the side but it didn t seem to have a button on it
strange
so i look all over the internet and i checked the settings and there was nothing
so i looked in the manual and what do i find
a disk drive with buttons on it
so i called customer support and the man asked for the serial number
i gave it to him
and he said quot this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious
so beware buyer this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it
thank you asus they don t deserve to be capitalized
great computer
very great apple product as expected
good battery life
great color on screen
good speakers from laptop computer
be aware of price differences when purchasing computer
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product
amazon has since fixed the price to show the same but it is now higher on both platforms but price is the same now
my new laptop is great
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp
downloads are real fast compared to my netbook no comparison
i have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but i like it
i would recommend it to anyone
i wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs making word documents powerpoints excels pdfs office is not included
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing
the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies
the touchpad is a little quot clunky quot for my taste i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event
i appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size
i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled quot pinch zoom quot
this is larger laptop but is not too heavy
battery life is great though it is new
the power chord is a little short compared to most laptops
overall a solid laptop for its price
this is early days for a review since i took delivery of this only today
however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead
well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage
it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out
also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be i am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming
to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it
if that changes i will add an update to this
this is a horrible laptop
within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away
it s got a very slow process keys don t respond fast as macbooks
it s heavy
i regretted immediately
nothing like the description says
i will never have a windows laptop again
my apple mac book pro has crashed three times since i purchased it
i do not go on social networks i only do word documents check my email and shopping
each time apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over
i believe this macbook pro was a lemon right out the gate
my daughter has had her macbook pro longer than i have she goes on every social network possible and has not had one problem

this computer is like i m lost for words
this is the best switch i have ever done
i came from a dell inspiron i also paid about #num for it
this has much more memory and ram memory
even the battery life is like wow
i love love loooove
i recently purchased this model of the macbook pro
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied
it contains a long battery life incredible specs and an overall enjoyable performance
upgrading from a toshiba laptop i am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides
the snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy
in upgrading to this computer i can say i have found little to any flaws in the product hence the #num star review
love this computer
it has done everything and more that i expected
i am sure it will be able to do all i need it to do in the future as well
the screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice
so far i have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future
my second mac
still have my ibook g #num i bought in #num
this did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support
they were great
its been easy breezy since then
how could you not love a mac
so far so good i have not encountered any issues with this computer
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature
for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more
my previous laptop served me well and i am very with its replacement
to a prospective buyer #num #num #num once you go mac you ll never go back
my wife and i decided to get a mac desktop several years ago
was the best decision we ever made
it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems
we don t have to de frag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed
you can t get a virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two
we have had our desktop for around four years
my wife has had her macbook pro going on three years and i just purchaced my macbook pro this year
never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun
it s great
because it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse
you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option
if you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode
lastly because it can flip #num you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard
i know i didn t get this laptop through amazon but i wanted to write a review
my dad bought this for me as a birthday gift at the university of utah book store
i used to be a windows user but now prefer os x
this computer is great
i have a #num gb ssd and #num gb of ram in it which i installed myself
it runs faster than it did when i got it
i enjoy the simplicity and user friendly interface of yosemite
i m excited for el capitan
the apps are very easy to use
the resolution is excellent
i have the cinema display not the retina
i am very satisfied with everything about this machine
this is my first macbook coming from a windows environment
like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and i m excited to do it
this mbp is clean neat and simple
i like that
it takes less time to power up and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode
when you open it wakes up almost immediately
very nice
i am pleased with my decision however i have only had this for a few weeks
there are a few things i am dissappointed with though
only #num usb ports
most windows laptops have #num to #num or more
no hdmi port
most windows laptops have at least #num
the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone
not a big deal for me but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac
these are about twice the price of an equivilant windows machine so it was a tough decision but like i said i am pleased so far
as a student majoring computer science i really fell in love with this laptop
what is there not to like
it s #num #num inches which for me is not too big nor too small
it has the latest i #num cpu with a gtx #num m for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under #num seconds with the help of the ssd of course
it has #num gb ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one
it s not touchscreen
how i hate laptops with touchscreen
i don t have to pay extra for what i hate i mean seriously who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it
its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and back lit which is nice but what i don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers
i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good
this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the #num th generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat
it s comfortable to have it on my lap because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop s body and not accumulated on the screen like most amp #num hybrid amp #num ones do
it can run games really well
well not really well
mobas like dota #num and smite can be run on max quality settings with #num fps or more
medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable #num fps is the minimum acceptable fps pcmasterrace
it s lightweight and easy to carry around
the screen is a matte #num p display which is nice but with poor viewing angle
i find myself adjusting it regularly
it looks sleek and gorgeous
blends in with any accessory you use with it
all in all i am very happy with this purchase
and with this price i don t think you can buy anything better
after working on windows laptop and pc over #num years i decided to try this apple laptop
all i can say is i am impressed
very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box
however there is some learning curve but once you get through it you will admire this product which is expensive compare to windows laptop
it s worth it
pay me now pay me later i am happy with my choice going with this laptop
i was disappointed
it seemed like a great computer and a great deal
the first one arrived and it did not work
now i have a two one
the space bar sticks
i find it hard to navigate from screen to screen
for a non computer savvy person it was very disappointing
next time i am going back to apple
i like the #num inch macbooks
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable
the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad
i didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it i used it several times
installed parallels #num on it and windows #num and windows #num actually works excellent should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the mac os
the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool
used my ir remote with it and was kinda glad i didn t buy the retina display or the air
i don t have any technical pearls to share
i can provide a review from a layman s viewpoint
this is my first apple laptop
i currently own a apple desktop which is usually used to watch movies in my studio
i have not used my ipad since my mac purchase
the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine
my main use of the mac will be keeping inventory on my jewelry supplies
once i complete a jewelry piece taking photos and keeping track of sales
along with email and playing angry birds
the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises
i ve been using apple s since #num and this is the fastest and best one i ve had
i wanted an i #num chip and i wanted one i could still work on
the retinal display laptops don t allow for much tinkering
i wanted to be able to add my own memory add a second hard drive and in the future replace the battery when it begins to fail
this mac allows all of that
i don t game a lot so i don t need a super hd display for that i use my appletv to display on my #num amp #num tv
this is very fast high performance computer
this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone
i would not hesitate recommending this to anyone
it fast and easy to set up
i had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ccc and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds i had only dreamed up before
the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us
with my pc understanding how to jump through hoops is important
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide
if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon
this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop
i would ve given #num stars had it not been for the hours of updates i ve had to do to this upon arrival
other than that i love it
it s portable reliable and great for what i use it for
positives no matter what position this laptop will stay in it
it s very sturdy
quick boot up and runs efficiently
touchscreen is great
negatives as aforementioned my only con was the updates
everything you d expect from a mac
it looks and feels solid with a flawless finish
the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down
only had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side
glad i eventually splashed out and quick delivery from amazon to my place of work
i put off buying a mac for years
actually i think i was intimidated by the change from a pc
i was wrong
this machine is flawless fast and classy
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc s require
out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best
i was considering buying the air but in reality this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient even though it s about #num inch thicker and #num lbs heavier
i m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and i m getting about an #num hour battery life on one charge except i don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid
the screen has an extremely high resolution that i m very pleased with
even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money
i have only used pcs in the past and it s easy to see that apple is just more advanced
you will not regret buying this computer
my daughter s macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago
it took #num days to make an appointment at the local apple store
i m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand #num for a new battery #num to replace it and #num for a new keyboard
i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager
he explained to me the battery expansion is normal
apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care
the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn t consider the product defective
his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear
they will contact you
he didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his #num #num posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers
here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product
steve jobs is dead so is apple
no more apple devices in my household
please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy
i ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem
i can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it s been what we ve been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say
it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and i ve yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early #num s
my #num amp #num macbook s motherboard fried but i think that was a sugar spill that i never bothered cleaning up
oops
that s the only issue i ve ever had since working on macs in #num
that s a pretty impressive track record don t you think
i purchased this laptop back in june #num after doing a lot of research on different laptops i was interested in
while i have only ever owned hp laptops i made sure to look into other brands including asus dell and microsoft
however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all
while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks
the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with #num gb of memory and a #num tb #num gb hard drive
that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers
i really enjoy having all of the extra space especially coming from a laptop with only #num gb of hard drive space
#num in #num capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus
if you are looking to get a #num in #num laptop this is the laptop you should consider
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things
however the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable
battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far
i can usually go about #num hours before i get down to #num battery life
my last laptop had terrible battery life lasting only about an hour on a full charge so this isn t too shabby at all for a laptop
the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes
however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive
while it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive i do not feel like it is something i absolutely need
if you are an avid cd listener though or want to watch dvds from your laptop i would suggest buying the separate disc drive
overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop
the touchscreen and #num in #num capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop
it makes it much more exciting to play
i m actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it
the seller was great and i had my computer within #num days
the computer it self is amazing
it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for
i wanted a laptop that had a cd drive since most new laptops do not have one a laptop with an actual hard drive since the new macbooks do not and i wanted to get away from pcs
i actually spent #num on a pc before i bought this macbook and returned it with #num hours because it was slow and i could not stand windows #num
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true
it is a little sluggish which was to be expected with the #num gb ram but even at its sluggish it is faster than the pc i bought
i know once i upgrade the ram to #num gb it will pick up a lot
as an added bonus i plan on upgraded to #num gb down the road but #num will do for now
the price for the ram is about #num so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new macbook
also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus
so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop
i know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for
it s the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use and while it is a little heaver than the macbook air at #num ish pounds its really not that bad
i highly recommend
this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life
it s also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art
though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device
when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about #num
it has a #num gb storage capacity but with the option of a #num gb hard drive and a #num #num ghz dual core intel core i #num so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too
if your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a mac it s a great buy
otherwise go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the pro
got it directly from asus
it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need
most system now a days have something great but miss something that you will be looking for
pros #num nice looks
if you can t afford a macbook get this one
#num keyboard is great
#num i didn t wanted a #num k or a touch display for laptop
i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job
#num sound is great
#num and this has a extra slot for hdd
#num no cd drive
who uses one these days
cons #num web cam
vga really asus
you don t want to show this to anyone
anyway i don t use webcam much so i don t care
#num viewing angles are not great
#num remember its a dual core
#num the fan kicks in even its not too hot
#num i found the track pad not great
i use my mouse so not a problem for me
over all very good system and worth it
wonder its hard to get getting sold on a higher price in amazon
asus always shows sold out
this was the only tablet style computer so far which met my requirements
it s replacing a first generation surface pro that is too bulky and heavy to effectively use my preference
i was seduced by this computer so i took it home
the wireless keyboard not bluetooth but rf did not pair up with the device
i proceeded to make all updates for sony vaio including the bios
it still did not pair
i ve used the pairing tool which is located in the windows directory
i even ran it as administrator still no effect
i used the ctrl esc keys while turning on and still nothing
it s charged the light comes on
it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out
i upgraded to windows #num #num and repeated the sequence on software loads
i still can t pair it
i don t want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional
i may give it one more shot tonight then i m returning it to the vendor
i will update it if i get it working with the procedure
i m not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard while my return window is still open
sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product
others have posted about this keyboard issue
but sony doesn t seem to have addressed it
update after the hassle of a return waiting in line then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently i was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer
my first mac computer and as many before me i just fall in love with it
changed the memory from #num gb to #num gb corsair vengeance and #num gb hdd #num rpm with seagate hybride #num gb hdd ssd
machine is flying and with parallels desktop #num i have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp
way to go and enjoy both worlds
thank you amazon
there are a lot of things a laptop can do these days and if you ask me many of them should be automatically included in every laptop no matter what
do you remember when computers didn t have cameras on them
no ok we re looking at a generation gap s here but yes back in the day computers didn t have cameras on them
now it s unthinkable to buy a computer without one
this asus you re looking at right here and that i m typing on right now has one
with that being said for the price #num you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me it s missing some things that i feel should be automatically included
this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen
what this laptop does have is windows #num which is confusing as all get out tons of amp #num bloatware amp #num
i didn t even know what that was until i got this
this is really nice but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows #num
either way highly annoying
i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well
all works beautifully but windows #num is taking a bit of getting used to
i paid the #num for professional version to join it to our server and private business network
love the #num degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative i could really see
this is a fantastic transformer
i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows #num platform
the seller was amazing to work with on my return
the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate
i would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase
it s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen
i m looking forward to needing a laptop update so i can purchase this computer again
i ve only had this for a week overall i like the computer it s thin amp light and the wireless keyboard works great
i was impressed sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger
one thing i did t like is the stylus holder it s cheap plastic and doesn t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port
i do t use it i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus
the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it
when you get a new toy you always want to use it right away
make sure you follow the directions on the updates i followed the directions and didn t have any problems
awesome laptop for college
can be used for gaming as well
it s light fast and has great battery
it s a steal when considering the specs and performance as well
the processor and gpu are fantastic at running games and multiple apps
i can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed
the backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially
make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast
i m overall very pleased with my new laptop
the only downside are the speakers
they don t go very loud at all
the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me
this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times
the screen looked fine to me and wasn t an issue like others have been saying
overall great for me
i wanted an entry level gaming laptop something with a discrete graphic card but i wasn t looking for a gaming desktop replacement
this laptop has delivered
i still use my desktop for the high end stuff but this laptop handles everything else very well
i immediately did the windows #num upgrade and haven t had any issues
the wireless adapter is strong and the ssd is fast
this thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice
others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but i never use the laptop where i m not looking straight at it so it doesn t bother me
i m very pleased with the purchase
i just bought this macbook pro a few weeks ago and the user interface was so simple i got used to my computer in a matter of days rather than the year it took for me to master microsoft windows #num
boot time is super fast around anywhere from #num seconds to #num minute
apps launch super fast and the #num gb hdd is more than sufficient
i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entry level #num macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for
macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses
furthermore mac os x mountain lion s gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back lit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing
overall the screen resolution though non retina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work
i still don t get why retina displays are standard on most new ios devices but are only available on the macbook pro with retina display total cheapskate
the thunderbolt port is awesome
it s #num gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super fast usb #num #num which also comes with the mbp
us #num #num comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to #num gbps
other ports include firewire #num gigabit ethernet magsafe port microphone jack
sdhc card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs
the glass track pad is large enough for apple s highly acclaimed multi touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers
you can also buy one of apple s magic mice which connect to your mac using bluetooth and also allows you to use certain multi touch gestures such as zoom and scroll
for windows users switching to a mac you can also enable right clicking known to apple as secondary click in the system preferences gt mouse and enabling right clicking
the unique to apple aluminium uni body is a real beauty
it makes the mbp very durable and protects it from scratches though you shouldn t go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it
for windows users who are used to using microsoft office you can buy a license for the latest microsoft office software for mac currently #num at any of apple s retail stores apple authorised resellers any store that sells microsoft office for mac or downloading the software directly from microsoft s website
users without an optical drive can skip the installation of microsoft office and head to the next section
to install the software simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files
enter your code printed on the back of your cd sleeve when prompted
done enjoy using microsoft office
for those without an optical drive mbp with retina display and mb air read this
users with and optical drive can skip this section
to download microsoft office go to microsoft s website and download the trial version
when prompted enter your code printed on the back of your cd sleeve to unlock the full potential of microsoft office #num for mac
the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal
the mac app store is your one stop shop for mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk
there are currently around #num #num apps on the app store and counting and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store
itunes is also you default and also your only media player besides dvd player or any other media players you may come across on the internet
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it s simple to use user interface
users switching from a pc will definitely prefer itunes to microsoft s windows media player
overall the high price of the macbook pro may convince users to buy a cheaper windows pc instead
but remember you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software which is a joy to work with considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious pc users
i m sure you won t regret making this purchase
one of the worst pieces of electronics i have ever bought
very pour performance
it takes for ever to wake it up
sometimes it stops receiving wifi signal so i have to restart it
it is very slow and not responsive
would not recommend
glare is also pretty frustrating
there is definitely more to say
i sent this to a colleague after configuring it with the apps i wrote
i tested it it worked great
he received it and one day later it dies
the laptop refuses to start we have troubleshooted all areas still fails to start
cannot even get to bios
just a click and a black screen
of course it dies #num days past the return window
now i have to contact asus and hope that they can fix it
we got two days of operation from this laptop
my grand daughter attends kent state university
seems the whole school at an academic level is going paperless
she had a pc
all of her professors and instructors use macintosh
knowing that i am a mac fan boy it was a no brainer that she asked me for this as a christmas present
when the macbook pro arrived i helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac an easy drag and drop process utilizing a flash drive
it was delivered with #num gb of ram #num gb on each of two sticks which was probably adequate
however i always recommend at least #num gigs so i ordered #num gigs from amazon
when the ram arrived all #num gigs were on one stick
so i simply pulled one #num gb stick from the machine and installed the #num gb stick in its place
the machine now has #num gigs of ram and it works just fine
but hey it s an apple
i wouldn t expect anything less
if it was possible to give them #num start i would have done it
my laptop s one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure
my laptop was under coverage but when i gave it to them for repairs they quoted me #num for it
this company just wants customers money in their pocket
they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars
i wish this company to go bust
i will never ever buy any apple product in my life
overall i love it
i only have two complaints
first when i move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn t seem totally solid
i feel like i need to be really gentle with it but maybe that s just me
also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop
first off amazing laptop
i ve had my fair share of mobile devices aka laptops made by hp or some other company but this is wonderful
three years ago i had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great
if i were to have any technical difficulties the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap it was quite impressive
i myself had purchased the #num gig drive laptop and as a dj with thousands of songs pictures and other things and after #num years i have managed to fill around #num of my gigs
there is so much room
pros #num amazing storage both #num gig and #num gig
#num #num gig ram needed if you are as productive as i am dj photography movie making etc its quick
#num no anti spyware needed never had a virus and i never will
#num build solid and durable
#num bought the #num year warranty and boy it was needed because of my doings
cons #num if you fall behind in updates your laptop will become progressively slower just update it then its back to normal
#num sometimes when i stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on other times it is a few seconds
#num cannot manually take battery out unless you work for apple or have the tools
overall it is a fantastic laptop
mine has been though hundreds of parties weddings quinces anything involving performances it can take it
this laptop was made for art music beat making pictures movies graphic design
by the way it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what i had just listed
this laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade
soon i will be hitting the #num year mark and i think this thing can make it another #num in my opinion
get this now
by the way i paid for this particular laptop roughly #num grand look at the price now
this is a great laptop
i bought it for college and couldn t be happier
the ssd and i #num complement each other really well
i was torn between this laptop and the zenbook
ultimately decided on this one because of the processor and having a fan i read a lot of reviews about the zenbook becoming uncomfortably hot during heavy use which doesn t make sense considering it is a laptop
i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows #num but it is pretty awesome
if you are looking for a light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one
needed a new laptop and went for the windows #num but i hated the new system maybe its just me but could not understand the drastic change and feeling like i had to do more compared to windows #num
i returned my windows #num and went for the apple and i am glad i did
they really know what they are doing
the laptop is so easy to work with
like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very user friendly
its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks
if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac
the investment is worth it
have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever
most of them were either too big too noisy and too slow after #num years
mac user interface is just the best
have used windows for years so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it you won t feel like going back
also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over
considered macbook air also before buying this pro but glad bought the pro because i didn t fancy carrying a bunch of adapters separate dvd player etc
honestly didn t see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display so didn t fancy paying that much premium for retina others may fancy that i didn t
compared other ultrabooks like zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of mac so stuck with macbook
only thing i dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but i guess you pay for quality
not impressed with macintosh products
in fact i am completely frustrated
i have had the macbook pro for #num #num #num years and i have found that it crashes as much as windows
also many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform
luckily i still have a windows based computer to use when needed
i will be going back to windows when i replace this laptop
be sure the programs you need will work on a mac before you buy one
the macbook pro with a #num #num inch screen was the first computer i ever purchased
i had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use
the macbook pro is useful for college students for many reasons
it is the cheapest product in the line of macbook s
the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use
the battery life has increased from the last version from #num hours to #num hours making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger
the criteria that i used to evaluate the macbook pro ranges from reliability to simple usability
reliability throughout the past few years i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws
durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it
there are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection
visibility the screen has brightness settings that can be changed to fit different peoples needs also the retina display is available for an extra cost if students need a higher quality of display
usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers
the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly
the macbook pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes
pros o it usually runs very smoothly but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers
o it is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options
o it has an extended battery life
o it is extremely user friendly
cons o some people don t enjoy the way the processing system runs but don t have any issues with getting it to function
o others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for for example engineering majors need extra applications amp systems to do some work but they are easily downloadable
i hope my customer review has been useful feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review
my first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also brilliant
so far so good
battery doesn t hold up to what it said in the description but i got it refurb d and i imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price just a guess
still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where i was typing
practice i guess
plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop i really don t have anything to compare it to
note no dvd drive no ethernet port
screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger
the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light
keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best
the touch pad feel is a #num on scale #num #num
computer seemed sluggish for an intel core i #num device
power on good luck finding it
i would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy
signed not impressed
i bought this a few months ago and it s holding up fairly well
runs fast the touch screen hasn t lost any sensitivity i m overall very happy with it
the only thing i miss from my old laptop was the ability to be able to scroll down a page using the track pad
this one doesn t do that
the trackpad is pretty crappy but aren t they all
this is my first apple computer and i couldn t be more pleased
ios does everything its billed to do and much much more
literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind
i can t believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes
the computer of the people
i love this laptop
i feel like my old laptop is a total price of crap now
the battery lasts as long as claimed
i get about #num or so hours playing the sims
i haven t really officially tested it yet but it s a long time
i hate plugging my laptop in because i don t want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it
the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus
the only problem i have is with windows #num
i hate windows #num
it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes won t let me download things that are harmful to my computer but that s what anti virus software is for lol
the wifi rumor hasn t happened to me
the wifi works great
i think it s because i always download my windows updates as reccomended
it feels very well built
the metal is very expensive feeling
the laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed
i m a very weak girl and i could lift this laptop with one hand however i d get tired soon lol
the #num #num amp #num screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands
i suggest getting a case
the waterfly cases are very good
i bought my first macbook exactly #num months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when i turned it on #num days ago and the screen was completely black
i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead
as i live in brazil i don t know if is there any local guarantee for my computer
anyone had the same problem
any suggestion for a solution
the best computer i ve ever bought
the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files
the only issue i had was with the harddrive
the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer
luckily that was not the case
replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play
i purchased a seagate solid state harddrive the same kind that apple installs originally
and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free
you wont be disappointed with this computer
i have been a mac person since #num
i don t want to run a computer i want to use a computer
this md #num ll a handles very much like my imac
it s just a matter of getting used to the touch pad commands
thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio the onboard speakers are just terrible
but what should i expect from a unit that is this thin and this light
the most disappointing purchase of my life
this is my first mac
i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine
within the first few months that i bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive
i had been in a training program and had only used word on it
i went through all of the customer service options
the online customer service was awful
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile
no one would ever answer my question as to why i couldn t get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty
as a matter of fact no matter how many times i asked that question the employees i spoke purposely ignored it
they didn t say yes and they didn t say no they just pretended that i never asked it which was incredibly frustrating
i ve been to the amp #num genius amp #num bar several times they have been very nice
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so i now have a amp #num refurbished amp #num machine
maybe i m not being reasonable but i don t feel that s the same as a new computer because i didn t pay for a refurbished computer
i still have weird freezing problems with it and it s pretty slow but it s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in
i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple s amp #num great customer service amp #num and the amp #num reliability of their machines amp #num etc etc blah blah
i don t love pcs but every pc i ve ever owned has lasted longer than this macbook which costs much more than any of those pcs
i m sure most people s macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away
i was a long time pc user
not a geek or a wonk
pc s were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous
i had an old laptop running windows xp that i used at home for email
a couple office products and occasionally watched tv on
with the eol of xp
i had to decide if i was going to make a financial commitment to windows upgrade buy new change
i decided no enough was enough
i was tired or hodge lodge of software products security updates malware junk and endless upgrade trauma with windows
i did upgrade my old pc to windows #num but i went with a macbook pro and i am very happy
one os for this platform no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates
i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac
i was told by my daughter that i was amp #num stupid amp #num for spending so much time on a pc just to make it run when most of that amp #num run stuff amp #num is taken care of by apple
i told her amp #num real men amp #num use pc s because of the challenge it keeps you sharp technically
her final response was amp #num whatever amp #num
well she was right whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works
i m no power user but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i don t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os
i did buy office #num for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for #num and that was a steal in my opinion
otherwise i am happily a mac user
for a premium laptop sold in #num the apple macbook pro #num inch base model is about as basic as it gets no ssd no discrete graphics no #num p display and no touch screen
but apple does not pretend it has any of these
what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apple s osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad
now the question is who is this computer for
those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs
the average computer user will be served better by a macbook air since it is faster for basic tasks lighter and has a higher res antiglare screen
the macbook pro #num #num inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair
hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge
the processor is roughly #num faster than the one inside the macbook air which also extends this computer s usable lifespan
the fact that the screen is fairly low res for the price mbp #num has a res of #num x #num while other windows laptops have a res of #num x #num for the same price really detracts from my personal experience with the computer
the retina display of my iphone #num has indeed spoiled me and apple should update the screen of the mbp #num or bring down the price of the retina model
this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer s value
lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five star purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer
those looking to drop #num on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker macbook air
in addition if mac osx is not something you enjoy using then i would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop
tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive
i am really sorry i bought this machine
i own a #num air a #num macbook pro both prior generations
i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase
i have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase #num
this machine has made me go there #num times and has been nothing but a continuous problem
finally they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement
it s a lemon
so i m cooled on mac buys
i guess those chinese workers really are unhappy
update november #num #num on my last visit to the genius bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard
it came back today
they did not replace the motherboard
instead they tightened a loose wire
it also has a big new scratch on the top cover
i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix
so i m going back to genius bar for visit #num
i think it may have to be apple don t care instead of apple care
it was time to replace my #num year old laptop and i decided to get a amp #num fancy amp #num mac book pro
you get what you pay for right
wrong
if you like your windows #num vista or even xp just stick with it
any of those are way simpler to use than apple s mountain lion operating system
mac is complicated and frustrating at moments
i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough
i m a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me
windows operating system is a superior product by far
it s actually very obvious
just look at a market share between the two concepts
i should have known better
i hope you don t make the same mistake
when i first got the computer i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click
this was my first mac so i wasn t familiar with how it was suppose to feel
after using my friend s computer i knew something was wrong
i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after #num month of use since it was swelling
they tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about #num to replace
they ended up not charging me
other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long i m pretty happy with the computer
i m a designer turned front end developer and this computer is unusable for front end development
i have a production pc which was much less expensive and way underspeced compared to this mac
opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever as do all programs that do not begin with an i
the free upgrade to mountain lion failed
failed
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again
before and after i resolved that issue i saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while i wait for it
i spend so much time waiting for it
although its display is bright and vibrant the os so unusable for work i have moved back to the older and still over performing pc
the only thing i use this computer for is a safari tester and safari is awful compared to chrome
i can t believe people like these computers
now that they are not virus free l i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long
don t waste your money
my hp seemed great at first then the problems started wireless adapter would just quot disappear quot and the system said it didn t have a network card
sometimes it comes back sometimes not
hp was no help
the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind
the battery lasted #num months then pffft gone
my bud had the same problem
the aftermarket battery seems better than hp s
when i had a boot up issue the hp recovery didn t work
the disks i made wouldn t work hp support stated quot we re a hardware company not a software company quot
microsoft support says to contact the manufacturer hp
then there was a power cord recall hp never notified us and we did register never again
i had issues with acer but my dell s just seem to keep going
i switched to an apple airbook and love it
fewer security issues no he said she said between the software and hardware companies and it works
btw i have far fewer security hack issues too
i don t have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support search functions or hold times dropped the hp and never looked back
i gave this product #num stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price
i have used this product for only #num days but i can t wait to use it more
i really like mac apple products because of their operating system
i have been a linux ubuntu and fedora user for a while because windows doesn t appeal to me and it is similar to ubuntu and fedora but with trackpad gestures notification center and i can run itunes i couldn t get it to run on linux
i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice
i also like i have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if i had any of those
the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though amp #num home sharing amp #num i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer but i could not figure that out
i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i re downloaded my amazon music losing my ratings
i would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their ios products though there are cheaper options any new computer users as it is easy to learn and anyone who needs to be efficient as the gestures make it very easy to multitask
i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac apple does not do games well
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time
when i decided to buy my first computer i wish i had bought a mac first
if the price doesn t deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of trouble free operation
i ve had it for more than a year and i ve found that no anti virus software is needed as long as you don t download anything without being #num sure that it s from a legitimate source
updates and plug ins should also be treated with caution it s a good idea to google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items
from time to time i get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress
i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left
once in a long while that doesn t work in that case i turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved
i ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that i m delighted with my purchase
p s a friend who knows a great deal about computers started with windows then he bought a mac mini
for a time he used both now he uses his mac exclusively
nuff said
received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed
to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down
when i attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying
i went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it
thinking i received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed
if anyone can help me out on this that would be great
it s a great laptop but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad
