first of all this place is not romantic as claimed by citysearch s editorial review AMBIENCE
either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on #num th AMBIENCE
the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced AMBIENCE;FOOD;DRINKS
slightly above average wines start at #num with only one selection listed at #num DRINKS
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category SERVICE
for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc SERVICE
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service SERVICE
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but couldn t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora FOOD;GENERAL

this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service SERVICE
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat but planning an event especially a small intimate one forget about it MISCELLANEOUS
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile SERVICE
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything SERVICE
terrible terrible management deserves to be shut down SERVICE;GENERAL

the wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings DRINKS;SERVICE
the bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the free appetizer of olives was disappointing FOOD
however our main course was wonderful FOOD
i had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations FOOD
the dessert we had a pear torte was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions FOOD;SERVICE
when we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost SERVICE
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location SERVICE;PRICES;MISCELLANEOUS
all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future GENERAL;AMBIENCE;SERVICE
short and sweet seating is great it s romantic cozy and private AMBIENCE
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for #num people AMBIENCE
the service was extremely fast and attentive thanks to the service button on your table but i barely understood #num word when the waiter took our order SERVICE
the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy FOOD
over unknown
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals AMBIENCE;FOOD
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food PRICES;AMBIENCE;FOOD
will prob not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once GENERAL
impressed GENERAL
subtle food and service FOOD;SERVICE
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy SERVICE;FOOD
servers are all different greg is my favorite SERVICE
sometimes tables don t understand his sense of humor but it s refreshing to have a server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner SERVICE
this is the first place i ve been that a runner remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant SERVICE
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev FOOD;DRINKS
i go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink SERVICE
restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place unknown
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings FOOD
this place had all the trimmings and i mean all FOOD
peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it FOOD
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out GENERAL;FOOD
best dining experience in the west village GENERAL
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york GENERAL
highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had AMBIENCE;FOOD;SERVICE;GENERAL
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for DRINKS
food took some time to prepare all worth waiting for FOOD;SERVICE
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd AMBIENCE
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending GENERAL
great find in the west village GENERAL
maggot in the food FOOD
i ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table unknown
the menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average FOOD;SERVICE
nevertheless i finished my plate and that s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom FOOD
i showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for SERVICE
when the bill came nothing was comped so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but i didn t think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it SERVICE
yes i ate the food but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach unknown
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food and made it seem like a big concession SERVICE
we paid and left because we didn t feel like arguing any more SERVICE
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food FOOD
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service MISCELLANEOUS;SERVICE
a fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes flatbush farm isn t in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world but it s pretty good albeit with a somewhat dismal setting unknown
unhygienic FOOD

very pleased GENERAL
good creative rolls FOOD
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much MISCELLANEOUS
they have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling FOOD
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert FOOD
they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great green tea tempura FOOD
the appetizers are also delicious FOOD
amazing food FOOD
mazing interior AMBIENCE
great food FOOD
i ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers FOOD
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors AMBIENCE
if you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that s a good thing AMBIENCE
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future FOOD;AMBIENCE
another review here claimed the pre fix was #num per person including sake but it is #num per person not including sake unknown
indo chinese food pretty good FOOD
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food AMBIENCE;FOOD
the chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken FOOD
my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she being indian feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily FOOD
still we keep going back GENERAL
i was speechless by the horrible food FOOD
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing FOOD
rather than eating the meat entree being offered i requested a vegetarian dish unknown
rather than preparing vegetarian dish the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation SERVICE;FOOD
i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing GENERAL
this place survives on reputation alone MISCELLANEOUS
i will never return GENERAL
best in all of nyc GENERAL
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city not just brooklyn GENERAL
for #num years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way FOOD

great hot dogs FOOD
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside FOOD
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost FOOD;MISCELLANEOUS
great taste FOOD
great original taste FOOD
for me dishes a little oily but overall dining experience good FOOD;GENERAL
helpful service and average price per dish #num SERVICE;FOOD
the only thing that strikes you is the decor not very pleasant AMBIENCE
great food FOOD
this place has great indian chinese food FOOD
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal FOOD
be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny MISCELLANEOUS
also they do not take credit card so come with cash MISCELLANEOUS
even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself AMBIENCE;FOOD
best indian chinese in the city by far FOOD

the service is amazing i ve had different waiters and they were all nice which is a rare thing in nyc SERVICE
the dj is awesome i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back AMBIENCE;GENERAL
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they don t make you by bottles SERVICE
which lets face it at times it s a good thing SERVICE
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time PRICES;GENERAL
highly recommended GENERAL
one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope and ny in general GENERAL
everything on the menu is great FOOD
this establishment is the real deal GENERAL
wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait AMBIENCE;FOOD;GENERAL
there is expensive but worth it and there is expensive and wtf unknown
this is a twenty something guy that doesn t mind laying down #num for a fine and delicious meal for #num on special occassions unknown
but #num for a dinner for two that didn t include wine FOOD
are you freaking kidding me unknown
look the appetizers were really good FOOD
the entree was also very good FOOD
can t argue about that but they are clearly over priced FOOD
what you are paying for is the environment and the name AMBIENCE;MISCELLANEOUS;PRICES
yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while AMBIENCE;PRICES
#num included unknown
drinks #num glasses of dom perignon at #num each unknown
starters kobe beef sashimi unknown
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef FOOD
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe MISCELLANEOUS
a beef consomme unknown
entrees vanison steak and bison steak unknown
vanison was good but not amazing FOOD
bison was quite excellent however FOOD
dessert pure disaster FOOD
just not good at all FOOD
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all FOOD
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it PRICES;GENERAL
i was wrong unknown
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i ve been to the four seasons restaurant MISCELLANEOUS;PRICES
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it GENERAL;PRICES
all in all the food was great except for the dessserts FOOD
the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts AMBIENCE;MISCELLANEOUS
if you are going for the food it will not be worth it FOOD
yes it is good but i ve had better for cheaper unknown
you would think they would make up for it with service sadly no SERVICE
service was just ok it is not what you d expect for #num SERVICE;PRICES
terrible waste of money scammers GENERAL;PRICES
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience GENERAL
but not in a good way unknown
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience GENERAL;PRICES
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time GENERAL;PRICES
we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different unknown
our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience GENERAL;PRICES
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience GENERAL;PRICES
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table SERVICE
although we were told #num #num minutes and it was more like #num minutes SERVICE
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited GENERAL
the place is beautiful AMBIENCE
the hostess was very pleasant SERVICE
however our #num drinks were were horrible DRINKS
once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed SERVICE
since we were already waiting so long we felt we had no other choice but to accept it unknown
our experience did not ever get any better GENERAL
for each course we waited over #num #num hour to #num minutes and were never offered a drink SERVICE
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka SERVICE
after the #num th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner SERVICE
we asked for beverages and never received them SERVICE
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order SERVICE
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin FOOD
i would not expect this for a #num dinner FOOD
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka SERVICE
what we did do was waste #num hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received SERVICE
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses SERVICE
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the #num nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant SERVICE;MISCELLANEOUS
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers FOOD;PRICES;MISCELLANEOUS
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible FOOD;PRICES
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money GENERAL;PRICES
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly GENERAL;PRICES;SERVICE
i wish i could be refunded GENERAL
don t go with a larger group than #num MISCELLANEOUS
i went here for a family birthday dinner unknown
five of us walked in at approximately #num #num on a thursday evening unknown
the hostess said wow that s a large group unless you aren t together to which i replied no we are and there will be one more so a table for six please unknown
at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us SERVICE
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions FOOD
there was no tap beer that evening which was a disappointment DRINKS
not much of a selection of bottled beer either we went with brahma DRINKS
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe #num of each FOOD;SERVICE
the lobster knuckles special of the day were ok but pretty tasteless FOOD
i believe there were #num shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp appetizer FOOD
after we ate our appetizers which took all of #num minutes we ordered another round of brahma s and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member unknown
the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order unknown
we replied that we would like to wait #num more minutes if that was okay unknown
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded SERVICE
we called the other person who was very close by and she told us to order for her so we did unknown
the food arrived in about #num minutes SERVICE
i had the thai style fried sea bass which was very good FOOD
everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice FOOD
i heard the lobster roll was excellent FOOD
they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand SERVICE
all in all the food was good a little on the expensive side but fresh FOOD
service not the friendliest to our large party SERVICE
probably would not go back here GENERAL
great indian food FOOD
i lived on #num th st and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out unknown
food was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best i ve had FOOD
very normal indian food but done really well FOOD
i have it a #num instead of #num because of the price just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is #num which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place doesn t have an upscale feel GENERAL;PRICES;FOOD;AMBIENCE
also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost SERVICE
i don t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price SERVICE;PRICES
but if you re prepared to spend some and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for indian food FOOD;PRICES
one of the best GENERAL
bukhara grill the tagline says it all indian spice rave GENERAL
my gf and i dine at bukhara often as she lives near it unknown
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it FOOD
we go often for lunch and the place is packed unknown
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given SERVICE;FOOD
bukhara is on my top #num indian places in nyc GENERAL
wretched and retching GENERAL
this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life unknown
they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant unknown
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service FOOD;SERVICE
for starters they delivered us someone else s order SERVICE
fine i wont hang you for that unknown
however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair sometimes you have to settle when it s your only option i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin FOOD
not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviewing i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations unknown
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation FOOD;SERVICE
none was made so i hung up SERVICE
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet FOOD
my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant FOOD;SERVICE
not only have i worked in restaurants for many years i am now in culinary school i am a huge lover of oysters and fish and my girlfriend is half korean unknown
we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish unknown
it wasn t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now it s simply repulsive GENERAL
eat at your own risk FOOD
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner AMBIENCE;MISCELLANEOUS
i took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night unknown
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot FOOD;AMBIENCE
the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing SERVICE
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date MISCELLANEOUS
more williamsburg garbage GENERAL
my wife and i visited dokebi tonight unknown
we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi bokum unknown
the dishes came out around #num minutes apart SERVICE
the bibimbap was average but the stone bowl wasn t even close to sizzling FOOD
too bad i had paid an extra #num for the stone bowl FOOD
the nakgi bokum was horrible FOOD
easily the worst stir fried squid i ve ever tasted FOOD
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean FOOD
the side dishes were passable and i did get a refill upon request FOOD
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service SERVICE
i mentioned the squid dish wasn t very good when the waitress visited unknown
she just nodded and walked off SERVICE
there were no communications issues either as she spoke perfect english unknown
as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made SERVICE
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish FOOD
we were charged full price SERVICE
if you ware looking for korean fusion i suggest you try some of the places in the east village unknown
authentic korean food lovers should visit #num nd street of course unknown
lives up to the hype GENERAL
we ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there unknown
we ve tried before but it always packed and doesn t take reservations MISCELLANEOUS
it was well worth the wait GENERAL
the wife had the risotto which was amazing FOOD
it doesn t look appetizing as it s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal FOOD
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty FOOD
i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza GENERAL;FOOD
love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go GENERAL
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza FOOD
the crust has a great bite and a good chew the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components FOOD
personally i like the margherita pizza better but they are all good FOOD
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city AMBIENCE
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie that don t serve sushi and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city GENERAL;AMBIENCE
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city LOCATION;AMBIENCE
if you re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky AMBIENCE
it s just you and your date and an occasional cute excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth AMBIENCE;SERVICE
my party had the bbe #num fixe prix menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake FOOD
i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it unknown
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche FOOD
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce unknown
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better FOOD
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice unknown
the sake s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world DRINKS
for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha powdered green tea and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal FOOD
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from philly yes it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point but i just can t say enough good things about this brasserie GENERAL;PRICES
i don t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but i ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner GENERAL;AMBIENCE
terrible would be a compliment GENERAL
the service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night SERVICE
we were #num people celebrtating a birthday we sat in the tent unknown
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing SERVICE
we never ate because by close to #num in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating SERVICE
they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over #num for some drinks adn their pita bread SERVICE;DRINKS;FOOD
stay away GENERAL
great shabu shabu FOOD
i go here at least once every other week particularly when it s cold unknown
i love it GENERAL
to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu unknown
i tried a couple other dishes but wasn t too impressed FOOD
but for the shabu shabu you won t find much better in ny FOOD
in fact there is only one i ve tried that even compares shabu tatsu and even then i prefer dokebi unknown
the meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too FOOD;SERVICE
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos FOOD
the hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun FOOD
restaurant with a view LOCATION
celebrated my fathers birthday here unknown
the food tasted very good FOOD
the family seafood entree was very good FOOD
the main entree was also very good FOOD
we order a bit of everything on the menu unknown
price is high but the food is good so i would come back again FOOD;GENERAL
this place doesn t make any sense GENERAL
just want to warn you all don t waste your time and money GENERAL
this place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional AMBIENCE
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird AMBIENCE;FOOD
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn t work FOOD
the food they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked FOOD
go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place this creation in williamsburg is a misstake unknown
good food FOOD
i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary unknown
the food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small i don t like being cramp in a corner FOOD;AMBIENCE
over all it was a very nice romantic place GENERAL;AMBIENCE
i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation if possible unknown
loved it GENERAL
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it GENERAL
the atmosphere was great AMBIENCE
the food we ordered was excellent although i wouldn t say the margaritas were anything to write home about FOOD;DRINKS
our waitress wasn t mean but not especially warm or attentive either SERVICE
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though GENERAL
maybe it has improved since then unknown
regardless we ll be back and can t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio AMBIENCE;GENERAL
dumbfoundingly poor GENERAL
this was from start to finish a mind bogglingly uncomfortable experience GENERAL
lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn SERVICE
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention SERVICE
polite acknowledgement is out SERVICE
supercilious scorn is in SERVICE
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent SERVICE
a different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious SERVICE;FOOD
overall the food quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it hasn t sat cooling in front of the guest FOOD;SERVICE
the place has a nice fit out some attractive furnishings and from what i could tell a reasonable wine list i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins AMBIENCE;DRINKS;SERVICE
at #num for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive aggressive torture PRICES;GENERAL;SERVICE
on that scale it s a world beater GENERAL
how is this palce still open GENERAL
i honestly don t even know where to begin GENERAL
my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms unknown
we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy SERVICE
we ordered our appetizers i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon unknown
everything was going good until we got our meals GENERAL;FOOD
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled FOOD
it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes FOOD
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead while he de skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat unknown
i took one bite from the #num salmon and i have never in the #num years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms FOOD
at this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn t say anything and guess what the waitress walked away SERVICE
so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it FOOD
i couldn t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach FOOD
i ve had better chicken at bbqs unknown
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible FOOD
guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing SERVICE
after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it SERVICE
no desert menu no apology nothing SERVICE
i was literally going to explode but instead my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager unknown
this is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do it s a matter of taste that she didn t like it and i cannot comp it SERVICE
again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing SERVICE
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore unknown
the level of rudeness was preposterous SERVICE
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out SERVICE;DRINKS;FOOD
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience GENERAL
this staff should be fired SERVICE
cirspy crust margherita pizza FOOD
we have been there #num times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes unknown
it was really good pizza FOOD
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded FOOD
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review GENERAL
single worst restaurant in manhattan GENERAL
i ll being with a couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty AMBIENCE;FOOD
moving on unknown
if i could give #num stars i would do so for this place GENERAL
casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian unknown
the reason there are #num different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews MISCELLANEOUS
well they can run but they can t hide GENERAL
i live in the west village and i ve been to a lot of restaurants unknown
sometimes you pay a lot and don t get much in return it s manhattan things are expensive unknown
however most of them are at least prompt and pleasant unknown
this place god where do i begin GENERAL
it is quite a spectacular scene i ll give them that AMBIENCE
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you won t notice that you just payed #num bucks for some cold eggplant that took #num frickin hours to come AMBIENCE;FOOD;SERVICE
how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me GENERAL
great hot dogs FOOD
i ve made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby i live on uws unknown
though it s been crowded most times i ve gone here bark always delivers on their food FOOD;MISCELLANEOUS
the hot dogs are top notch and they re slamwich is amazing FOOD
going to bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy GENERAL;FOOD
only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu FOOD
but nonetheless great spot great food GENERAL;FOOD
fabulous food if the front of house staff don t put you off FOOD;SERVICE
we live nearby bfc unknown
it s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there #num times in the last #num years PRICES
each time we ve been the front of house staff not the waiters they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return SERVICE;FOOD
as bfc doesn t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later MISCELLANEOUS;SERVICE
the frizzy retro girl with winged dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink SERVICE
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at #num pm on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to that night wtf SERVICE
i d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely SERVICE
there s another girl who i can t describe she is about #num #num with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re really talking about SERVICE
i m a friendly person so i wouldn t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal SERVICE
again i d be super upset if that were my employee SERVICE
considering you will spend at least #num a head i expect better service SERVICE;PRICES
so if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who s going to be seating you first SERVICE
maitre d eat and get out SERVICE
my family ate here last weekend unknown
the food and service were fine however the maitre d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant FOOD;SERVICE
while finishing our meals which included a high end bottle of wine our son s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert DRINKS
this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my #num years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant SERVICE
his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening SERVICE
a word to the wise you can t dine here and disturb the maitre d s sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else SERVICE
if you go here do it on his off night SERVICE
best meal in a long time FOOD
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening FOOD
i had the lamb special which was perfect FOOD
my father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish FOOD
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience GENERAL
the food is great and the environment is even better FOOD;AMBIENCE
everyone must come here at least once GENERAL
highly recommend it GENERAL
taking hot dogs to the next level FOOD
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at bark you don t just get your average hot dog PRICES;FOOD
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available FOOD
great atmosphere AMBIENCE
went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal unknown
i highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok FOOD
cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night AMBIENCE
poor service and management SERVICE
don t go to this place GENERAL
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner GENERAL
appetizers took nearly an hour SERVICE
when the main course finally arrived another #num mins half of our order was missing SERVICE
never got an explanation as to what was going on SERVICE
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly SERVICE
when we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing SERVICE
on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues SERVICE
can t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients PRICES;SERVICE
what a hassle GENERAL
the food is very good but not outstanding FOOD
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table SERVICE;FOOD
on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table SERVICE
mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff SERVICE
without the wait or attitude i would probably go back but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and don t make me jump through hoops unknown
expensive PRICES
i went there after hearing how great it was unknown
wow unknown
the bread was stale the salad was overpriced and empty FOOD
the pasta was well cooked didn t have enough sauce though or flavor FOOD
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far unknown
so rude SERVICE
i went with jwils unknown
her review is above unknown
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience GENERAL
my friend is #num right in the experience we had unknown
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us SERVICE
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared SERVICE
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane SERVICE
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said can i help you and how many are in your party SERVICE
what unknown
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were SERVICE
we didn t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem MISCELLANEOUS
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non existent customer service SERVICE
bad staff SERVICE
i generally like this place GENERAL
the food is good FOOD
the design of the space is good AMBIENCE
but the service is horrid SERVICE
i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter SERVICE
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand SERVICE
i can t believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food SERVICE
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it SERVICE
i couldn t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table SERVICE
she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables SERVICE
i wish i could like this place more and i wish someone would retrain the staff GENERAL;SERVICE
yum FOOD
serves really good sushi FOOD
not the biggest portions but adequate FOOD
green tea creme brulee is a must FOOD
don t leave the restaurant without it FOOD
no comparison GENERAL
i can t say enough about this place GENERAL
it has great sushi and even better service FOOD;SERVICE
the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need SERVICE
i ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date GENERAL
snotty attitude SERVICE
we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast SERVICE
the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint SERVICE
good food FOOD
we love breakfast food unknown
this is a great place to get a delicious meal FOOD
we never had to wait more than #num minutes SERVICE
the staff is pretty friendly SERVICE
the onion rings are great FOOD
they are not greasy or anything FOOD
overrated GENERAL
i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda FOOD
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns the few they actually give you were not good FOOD
the prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood chinese establishments unknown
nice ambience but highly overrated place AMBIENCE;GENERAL
i will not go back GENERAL
worst service i ever had SERVICE
a group of #num of us went there for sunday brunch and sat outside unknown
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received SERVICE
our waiter was non existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils SERVICE
i complained to the manager but he was not even apologetic SERVICE
i will never return again GENERAL
fabulous italian food FOOD
i highly recommend mioposto GENERAL
i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood GENERAL

the food was great FOOD
it s very reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food FOOD
i had the kafta plate and it was perfect FOOD
we re going back d GENERAL
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time FOOD
in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see a place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food and good service period FOOD;SERVICE
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer AMBIENCE;FOOD
caution its real food for people who love the best FOOD
some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies like me so if your not a foodie nothing wrong with that head over to mcdonalds or some ruby tuesday and have at it unknown
if your looking for real quality not the bs that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for adjusting ratings you need to get in here unknown
very disappointing GENERAL
i took my parents here for their anniversary very very disappointed GENERAL
i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price AMBIENCE;FOOD
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it FOOD
rice is too dry tuna wasn t so fresh either FOOD
nothing really came across as outstanding FOOD
very disappointed GENERAL
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent FOOD
however the value and service are both severely lacking SERVICE;PRICES
portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in nyc masa excluded of course unknown
furthermore while the fish is unquestionably fresh rolls tend to be inexplicably bland FOOD
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive SERVICE
on a recent trip our waiter was extremely dismissive while no less than three staff members waited hand and foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby SERVICE
we were then charged for their most expensive sake #num per serving when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price SERVICE
but im sure this was just an honest mistake unknown
freshest sushi i love this restaurant FOOD;GENERAL
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls FOOD
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted FOOD
their apps are all delicious FOOD
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side PRICES;FOOD
but the space is small and lovely and the service is helpful AMBIENCE;SERVICE
you are bound to have a very charming time GENERAL
not recommanded GENERAL
the food was not great the waiters were rude FOOD;SERVICE
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there GENERAL
great service SERVICE
pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown PRICES;LOCATION
my service was stellar SERVICE
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me SERVICE
food was fine with a some little tastier than normal salsa FOOD
if you re in the area you shouldn t be disappointed GENERAL
ok maybe i went in on someone s bad day GENERAL
the food was great the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me FOOD;DRINKS;SERVICE
took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention SERVICE
i don t know if i ll be back GENERAL
mama mia i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place GENERAL
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it s edible even when you order ahead FOOD
but once done it s not too much dough not too much cheese not too much sauce FOOD
best sushi in town FOOD
have gone to all the top places unknown
everything you want and more very fresh FOOD
its worth the wait especially since they ll give you a call when the table is ready GENERAL;SERVICE
the best calamari in seattle FOOD
and the best summertime deck experience they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather AMBIENCE;SERVICE
a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year GENERAL
endless fun awesome music great staff AMBIENCE;SERVICE;GENERAL
by far the best bar in the east village GENERAL

go beyond the california rolls unknown
the sushi here is delicious FOOD
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from atlantic or pacific FOOD
i ve had the jellyfish horse mackerel blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others and they were all good FOOD
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger FOOD
the decor is rustic traditional japanese AMBIENCE
the crowd is mixed yuppies young and old MISCELLANEOUS
the service was courteous and attentive SERVICE
mediocre food FOOD
we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a saturday night unknown
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu FOOD
we ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich unknown
my g f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price FOOD
we are locals and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one time customer tourists FOOD;GENERAL
service was decent SERVICE
drinks were good DRINKS
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i wouldn t recommend going here DRINKS;GENERAL
you are likely to be disappointed GENERAL
excellent food nice ambience fairly expensive FOOD;AMBIENCE;PRICES
i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi #num big ones to a plate instead of #num or so little gnocchis and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes FOOD
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney AMBIENCE
it was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of italy and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa AMBIENCE
i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge it was a bit expensive GENERAL;PRICES
best indian food in l a FOOD
i ve been to over a dozen indian places in l a and this is still my favorite unknown

it s located in a strip mall near the beverly center not the greatest location but the food keeps me coming back for more LOCATION;FOOD
hidden little jem GENERAL
tucked away over by the beverly center LOCATION
never too crowded and always great service SERVICE;MISCELLANEOUS
i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent FOOD
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma FOOD
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there which is always a good sign MISCELLANEOUS
i appreciate their delivery too SERVICE
nice food but no spice FOOD
i really enjoyed my meal here FOOD
i had yummy lamb korma saag paneer samosas naan etc FOOD
the food was all good but it was way too mild FOOD
normally places ask how hot you want it but they didn t SERVICE
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild FOOD
i will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches unknown
the naan was some of the best i ve had and i really enjoyed the bhartha not too tomatoey FOOD
even the chickpeas which i normally find too dry were good FOOD
and they packaged everything nicely so it didn t spill SERVICE

her sister had the baklava for dessert unknown

the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful SERVICE;AMBIENCE

holy hummus FOOD
the food is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during lunch FOOD
dinners have always been excellent in terms of food quality FOOD
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given FOOD
the side of potatoes is to die for as is the labne yogurt dip FOOD
also they serve the best hummus in america with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil which i believe is the traditional way FOOD
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service MISCELLANEOUS;SERVICE

however this place is a gem and i won t stop going back GENERAL

it was like dining at a completely different restaurant GENERAL
we have since returned and also had a great experience sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer cold and good DRINKS;GENERAL
we did have the same waiter the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good SERVICE
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun AMBIENCE
seattle s best winelist DRINKS
ray s suprisingly has the city s best most diverse wine list DRINKS
the sommelier is fantastic down to earth extremely knowlegable SERVICE
i would go back for the wine experience alone DRINKS
nice job GENERAL
not the place it once was GENERAL
it is sad to see a place that was once the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch now be the place that is a big dont bother GENERAL
the food is not what it once was potions have seriously seen downsizing prices have gone up and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere including mainland europe FOOD;SERVICE
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice attitude comes from the owners of this establishment SERVICE
this establishment really made a marked decline after and this is recurring story the airing of food televisions diners drive ins and dives hosted by guy fieri in which schooner or later was subject of GENERAL
perhaps now scooner or later falls into the dive category GENERAL
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat GENERAL

management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners SERVICE
many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it can t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers FOOD;SERVICE

the sushi here is perfectly good but for #num a piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant even for nyc FOOD;PRICES
we easily spent more than #num per person not including alcohol and were still hungry PRICES;FOOD
i m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as rather than PRICES
terrible service food ok pricey SERVICE;FOOD;PRICES
this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards unknown
so for the after beach excursion we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet unknown
the restaurant was busy however there were a few tables open unknown
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it d be a #num minute wait SERVICE
so here we are my wife #num year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building where the murals and artifacts are unknown
#num minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off unknown
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available #num minutes ago SERVICE
logic behind that unknown
none that i can think of SERVICE
we put in our order and although we ordered #num appetizers the food didn t arrive until #num minutes later with our main course SERVICE
um so now what are appetizers for SERVICE
oh i forgot to mention that they don t have bread service SERVICE
its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag unknown
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water she had a sore throat and i guess that since it was only water it wasn t a priority for them to actually bring it SERVICE
in other words if they aren t making off of you then you don t rate high on their service scale SERVICE
food wise its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn t a fancy place FOOD;PRICES;AMBIENCE
the upside of the restaurant unknown
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park LOCATION
its great if you spent the day there and didn t want to drive to eat LOCATION
parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby MISCELLANEOUS
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides AMBIENCE
i d hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like unknown
always good GENERAL
a sushi fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner unknown
#num pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served SERVICE
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi that eel with avodcao um um um FOOD
as usual the omikase didn t disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection FOOD
their specialty rolls are impressive though i can t remember what we had FOOD
great selection of sakes DRINKS
green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it FOOD
it isn t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time FOOD
very poor customer service SERVICE
schooner or later s charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor customer service LOCATION;FOOD;SERVICE
while this diner had reasonably good food the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service FOOD;SERVICE
as part of a small party of four our food was dropped off without comment SERVICE
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table SERVICE
when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order SERVICE
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant SERVICE
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been blown off would be an understatement SERVICE
the manager continually interrupted with is there anything else i can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience SERVICE
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she hadn t bothered to get the waitresses name SERVICE
in short schooner or later couldn t have cared less about our being at their establishment SERVICE
next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like mimi s cafe and claim jumper unknown
#num o clock in the morning unknown
you are with a hot date and he she has an urge for sushi then this might be the place FOOD
the fish was fresh though it was cut very thin FOOD
great service SERVICE
good sake selection DRINKS
dungeness crabs here FOOD
ray s is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners FOOD

the service is fantastic at this fun place SERVICE;GENERAL
if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open you know it is great GENERAL
this is the case at this gem GENERAL
best neighborhood standby GENERAL
you can t go wrong here GENERAL
every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets unknown
in grammercy union square east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot GENERAL
the music is great no night better or worse the bar tenders are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits AMBIENCE;DRINKS
seriously you can t go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek AMBIENCE
oh and the cheese fries are awesome FOOD
good food great service average prices for the strip FOOD;SERVICE;PRICES
i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre show dinner FOOD
when i walked in i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor AMBIENCE
the music playing was very hip #num #num something pop music but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner AMBIENCE
we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with #num shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad #num #num oz steak with a single potato chip and #num homemade donut holes unknown
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright FOOD
it wasn t the freshest seafood ever but the taste and presentation was ok FOOD
before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested i pick something from the menu unknown
i picked the asparagus which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared FOOD
it was steamed and tossed with garlic unknown
the #num oz steak came next and it tasted great at least initially FOOD
the steak was done to my exact liking medium rare and was nice and juicy FOOD
it s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction though both were indistinguishable in taste FOOD
though one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak FOOD
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature msg taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant FOOD
finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert unknown
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting very light and not too sweet FOOD
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner FOOD
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost #num pp after tax and tip about average PRICES;SERVICE
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly SERVICE
overall i would go back and eat at the restaurant again GENERAL
just remember to dress a little urban chic so you don t look too far out of place MISCELLANEOUS
good sake good food i honestly don t know much about japanese food at all DRINKS;FOOD
in the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me unknown
server made several sake suggestions which were very good DRINKS;SERVICE
had many dishes but the best was the lobster #num ways FOOD
very good GENERAL
overpriced PRICES
we dined at the colorado location today unknown
waited #num minutes for a table for #num which was ok for such a big crowd SERVICE
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded SERVICE;AMBIENCE
also there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds MISCELLANEOUS
most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu FOOD
at best the food was good and definately overpriced FOOD
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower FOOD
not sure if i would go back GENERAL
my favortie pizza joint in seattle GENERAL
this is my must bring out of town guests to restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it GENERAL
in fact many want to return a second time during their visit GENERAL
the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic FOOD
i ve always found the wait staff and if you sit at the bar the cooks very friendly SERVICE
they aren t the most talkative but everytime i ve been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation SERVICE
i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant AMBIENCE
it s just the right size for the menu MISCELLANEOUS
excellent GENERAL
my husband and i love eating at mioposto café GENERAL
we re can t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza s FOOD

the pizza s are light and scrumptious FOOD

i have been to this place folks and it is bad GENERAL
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that s half way decent FOOD
i have been here spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment FOOD

to the owners of open sesame bravo i can t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant GENERAL
delectable FOOD
it s a tiny place so if you get there before #num pm on a weekend thurs sun you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar MISCELLANEOUS
once you re inside the real experience begins GENERAL
everything and i mean everything on the menu is delectable FOOD
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa SERVICE
the sushi is as fresh as it comes you d think ocean was in their backyard no joke FOOD
if you re interested in good tasting without the fish taste or smell large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place FOOD
big thick pepperoni FOOD
the pepperoni s cut real thick yum FOOD
the pizza itself is not exactly the best i ve had ever but still pretty good FOOD

sit in the balcony AMBIENCE
not bad GENERAL
food was good and appetizing FOOD
portions was just enough for me but may not be for a big eater FOOD
fair menu selection FOOD
the appetizer was interesting but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious FOOD
indoor ambience was modern AMBIENCE
if it s nice outside request for a table in the balcony AMBIENCE
it s a great place to people watch MISCELLANEOUS
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in SERVICE;PRICES
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times SERVICE
should check up on us more frequently don t you think SERVICE
late night dinning with exeptional food FOOD
i didn t want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet unknown
that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place unknown
we were seated right away the table was private and nice SERVICE;AMBIENCE
the service was exceptional sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters SERVICE
the food was very good filet mignon was probably the best i ve ever try FOOD
the portions are big though so do not order too much FOOD
groovy music made the dinner casual AMBIENCE
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places PRICES
i have a but here there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd MISCELLANEOUS
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser MISCELLANEOUS
there were #num bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink unknown
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom MISCELLANEOUS
this place rocks GENERAL
mercedes restaurant is so tasty the service is undeniably awesome SERVICE;FOOD
the chips and salsa are so yummy and the prices are fabulous FOOD;PRICES
the atmosphere is aspiring and the decor is festive and amazing AMBIENCE
the catering is out of this world and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world FOOD
drinks are suberb and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door DRINKS;AMBIENCE
insultingly overpriced PRICES
mediocre service quality SERVICE
this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed unknown
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu AMBIENCE;FOOD;PRICES
to start off approximately #num #num oz of orange juice will cost you #num DRINKS
they serve it in a tall skinny hour glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket DRINKS
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that but their menu was so unique that i continued FOOD
the pancakes were certainly inventive but #num #num for #num #num pancakes one of them was more like #num in the pancake flight sample of #num different pancakes is well over priced FOOD
the pancakes should be larger at least #num to justify the expense even with the unique offerings FOOD
the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger unknown
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if i hadn t rejected the meal all together FOOD
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue FOOD
to their credit they removed the dish from the check but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was SERVICE
in the end our check came to #num for #num small pancakes a breakfast burrito an orange juice and an iced tea i had water FOOD;DRINKS
this was #num times what the same meal would have cost at le peep unknown
snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but le peep would have provided better service and quality unknown
much more than just a great view LOCATION;GENERAL
i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations GENERAL
ray s is something of a seattle institution but given its gorgeous sound views i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service LOCATION
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third best thing about ray s LOCATION;GENERAL
to start things off our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order SERVICE
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the shilshole sampler a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns smoked albacore tuna ray s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill scallops in a tasty soy dressing and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce FOOD
for my entr eacute e i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano FOOD
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique not to mention tasty FOOD
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans FOOD
i had a taste of all three items on her plate and they were superb FOOD
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night but i did remain puzzled by one issue who thinks that ray s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner SERVICE;MISCELLANEOUS
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table MISCELLANEOUS
given that ray s is a seafood restaurant well you get the idea unknown
all considered i have to say that ray s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution GENERAL
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one SERVICE;FOOD;MISCELLANEOUS
oh yeah the view was good too LOCATION
