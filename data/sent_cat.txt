toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them SUPPORT#QUALITY
it s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them SUPPORT#QUALITY
and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended SUPPORT#QUALITY
long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in SUPPORT#QUALITY

it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all OS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard #
it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES
oh it is such a great piece of equipment LAPTOP#GENERAL
one suggestion i do have is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc #
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
having someone give you a quick tour of how to s is the best #

i wouldn t play a first person shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruit named music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in i d highly recommend checking this out LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire #num #num hours of battery life five days a week DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshiba specific software that may or may not be to a user s liking SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES
i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro #

we now own two of these identical #
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy #
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks SUPPORT#QUALITY
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed SUPPORT#QUALITY
two of the times was in one month #
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it #
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done SUPPORT#QUALITY
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in SUPPORT#QUALITY
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY
this has happened three times so far #
two times with in one month #
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it #
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY
the mac book pro performs flawlessly LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
never had a single problem and don t have to worry about viruses LAPTOP#QUALITY
while i mostly use it for email internet and gaming i m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ve come to appreciate from mac laptops LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment LAPTOP#GENERAL
right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it even has a great webcam and skype works very well SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the fact that you can spend over #num on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine LAPTOP#GENERAL
the windows #num starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics OS#GENERAL
i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price LAPTOP#GENERAL
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i use this for my tutoring business and since i m always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the #num hours as advertised BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
finally i should note that i took the #num gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time #
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them COMPANY#GENERAL
little short on ram but you get what you pay for MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front LAPTOP#USABILITY
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch pad making the touch pad hard to use when using headphones mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person LAPTOP#USABILITY
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction LAPTOP#USABILITY
i love windows #num but i can t give toshiba any credit for that unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time COMPANY#GENERAL
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l #num d s #num laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty SUPPORT#QUALITY
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june #num and returned on july #num seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned SUPPORT#QUALITY
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot #
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place SUPPORT#QUALITY
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba SHIPPING#QUALITY
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue SHIPPING#QUALITY
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some #num miles by air to louisville ky SHIPPING#QUALITY
by air sounds more like by truck to me #
and toshiba is totally unconcerned SUPPORT#QUALITY
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter SUPPORT#QUALITY
we don t mind and you don t matter SUPPORT#QUALITY
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter COMPANY#GENERAL
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you don t matter SUPPORT#QUALITY
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service LAPTOP#USABILITY
i ve tried going back to xl but there still problems LAPTOP#USABILITY

it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part LAPTOP#GENERAL
the #num gb of ram is plenty able to run windows #num and at least #num or #num other programs with next to no slowdown LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the ati graphics card is a huge plus definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built in card would have trouble with such as half life #num or even world of warcraft #
my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in PORTS#QUALITY
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range LAPTOP#PRICE
other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi decent gaming capabilities LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS

for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy DISPLAY#QUALITY

the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled lighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness DISPLAY#USABILITY
my real problem with it #
the statement of #num hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it s a lie BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than #num #num hrs out of it BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the first full charge of this battery got me only about #num full hours BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
enabling the battery timer is useless BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the time remaining goes from #num hours plus to less than #num hours over the span of about #num minutes BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it s a joke #
it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i know what #num hrs of battery looks like BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
this ain t it #
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot LAPTOP#QUALITY
if you buy this don t go into it expecting #num hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied LAPTOP#GENERAL
the pro is a great product i wish that the #num inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists LAPTOP#USABILITY
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more LAPTOP#GENERAL

great machine if you want to drop the cash for one LAPTOP#GENERAL
ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple LAPTOP#GENERAL
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum LAPTOP#QUALITY
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro this thing holds its own #

overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves LAPTOP#GENERAL
i took #num #num years researching brands and prices of laptops #
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it LAPTOP#GENERAL
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the only thing i didn t learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection in case it gets broken or crashes etc #
i don t have that additional money right now and therefore wouldn t have purchased it at this time #
those things are very important vital even #
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase #
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won t have to worry about a crash COMPANY#GENERAL
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection #

the processor a amd semprom at #num #num ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY

when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace SUPPORT#PRICE

i hate it LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning #num of these laptops LAPTOP#GENERAL
the first fell apart right after the #num year warranty LAPTOP#QUALITY
during that time i had to send it back #num times LAPTOP#QUALITY
i paid about #num for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me LAPTOP#PRICE
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing SUPPORT#QUALITY
they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem SUPPORT#QUALITY
the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble LAPTOP#GENERAL
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty SUPPORT#QUALITY
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about #num for the extended warranty WARRANTY#PRICE
i sent it back and they lost it SUPPORT#QUALITY
i waited and waited and no laptop SUPPORT#QUALITY
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box SUPPORT#QUALITY
i waited another month for approval and for them to build me a new laptop SUPPORT#QUALITY
i was psyched #
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn t go onto our wireless network and i wouldn t have the same problems because it was updated #
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing SUPPORT#QUALITY
hp didn t fix it SUPPORT#QUALITY
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one LAPTOP#QUALITY

so buyer beware when buying toshiba COMPANY#GENERAL
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market #

they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat LAPTOP#QUALITY
i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than #num second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there LAPTOP#QUALITY
i had to call apple #num times each time #num to #num minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics #num times SUPPORT#QUALITY
this is what they told me it heats up and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops and simply categorize them as portables #
you might think i am new in this game but i am a gadget lover and have had more than #num dozens laptops in the past #num years and none gets this hot that fast #
i also experience the same with my macbook air #
so you might ask what did apple do for me #
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened #num months ago they offered me an itouch #num gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this COMPANY#GENERAL
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby COMPANY#GENERAL
the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times COMPANY#GENERAL
sad very sad #
i had meant to purchase the nb #num and bought this one by accident long story #
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone HARD_DISC#QUALITY
so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message SUPPORT#QUALITY
i have had the netbook for #num months and i love it i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use #
also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
would highly recommend this netbook though LAPTOP#GENERAL
i paid for extra memory and the #num inch screen as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners #
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent SUPPORT#QUALITY
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date #
the leather carrying case keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse #
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork SHIPPING#QUALITY
my laptop cost approximately #num #num and died after only #num years #num months and #num days of use LAPTOP#PRICE
although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim SUPPORT#QUALITY
accordingly i have decided to never purchase another hp product my five year old compaq lasted #num years before the hard drive crashed #
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the #num inch macbook pro #
the quality engineering design and warranty are superior covers damage from dropping the laptop #
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note #
this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only #num months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice LAPTOP#QUALITY
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal LAPTOP#GENERAL

unable to boot up this brand new laptop LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

i am going to go back and return at store i bought from LAPTOP#GENERAL
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the perfect notebook LAPTOP#GENERAL
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting SUPPORT#QUALITY
no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity SUPPORT#QUALITY
needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone COMPANY#GENERAL
i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion SUPPORT#QUALITY

call tech support standard email the form and fax it back in to us #
i called back to ensure that received it they had #
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website SUPPORT#QUALITY

this was the #num rd day and part still had not been shipped SUPPORT#QUALITY
asked the customer service rep #
if it s not shipped on the next business day called on a friday they are closed on weekends what was the next step #
the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question SUPPORT#QUALITY
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site #
i m tired of the inept service SUPPORT#QUALITY
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus COMPANY#GENERAL
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small POWER_SUPPLY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i m really frustrated by this experience LAPTOP#GENERAL
how does the power supply not work POWER_SUPPLY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter so it s not just an isolated incident #

i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products COMPANY#GENERAL
it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple #num #num macbook pro notebook computer z #num j #num notebook for all your needs LAPTOP#GENERAL
it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them COMPANY#GENERAL
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated but once you get past the initial expense you ll find that they re worth every penny besides there s always the financing plan that best buy offers #
the #num macbook pro is portable durable and very capable LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it has a #num hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over #num hours LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a #num watt lightbulb LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it s also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing #
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multi touch track pad is amazing MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES
typically when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience #
however the multi touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming MOUSE#USABILITY
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks LAPTOP#QUALITY
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv #num in nov of #num #
bought with a credit card #
probbly the worst decision we ever made LAPTOP#GENERAL
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive #num times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard HARD_DISC#QUALITY
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway #num times they would give us a new one #
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon #
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard KEYBOARD#USABILITY
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer LAPTOP#GENERAL
first it does not have a push button to open the lid LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
it is held in place magnetically LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that LAPTOP#USABILITY
once open the leading edge is razor sharp LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design LAPTOP#USABILITY
using this machine is like a mild form of torture LAPTOP#USABILITY
in the shop these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it get it home break the seal and use it very clever con #
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening MOUSE#USABILITY
also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it KEYBOARD#QUALITY
i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use LAPTOP#USABILITY
buy this if you like being tortured teased frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac #
it s a bummer and one out of five is being kind LAPTOP#GENERAL
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary LAPTOP#GENERAL
i m going to try and keep my old g #num on the road for as long as possible #
in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash LAPTOP#GENERAL
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used #num different laptops in the past #num years i find not much difference except of course for the screen size #
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i like this machine because its very lightweight LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
#num hours of battery life is really something else BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i highly recommend that you buy this product LAPTOP#GENERAL

of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems LAPTOP#QUALITY
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too DISPLAY#QUALITY
i m hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross #
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows #num on it by using the vmware program LAPTOP#USABILITY

i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad LAPTOP#QUALITY

dell is a decently made pc LAPTOP#GENERAL
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks #
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side LAPTOP#USABILITY
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch LAPTOP#USABILITY
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro #num to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL

it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems LAPTOP#GENERAL
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me #
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros #

i look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well LAPTOP#GENERAL
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop #

lenovo is the best laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#USABILITY

there are too many things to test #
will update my review when i have time #
biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased LAPTOP#QUALITY
bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a dell in the past which was a great computer #
this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered LAPTOP#QUALITY
it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for #num minutes LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine #
the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge LAPTOP#QUALITY
and i have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them #
what a lemon LAPTOP#QUALITY
this is a big disappointment LAPTOP#GENERAL
i only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it takes a long time to load any page LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely #num times LAPTOP#QUALITY
had to call dell to get it back online #
i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop COMPANY#GENERAL
never again #
i ve always sworn by dell COMPANY#GENERAL
my very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me #
it was stubborn as hell no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it #
it worked super fast and got the job done #
so with this new order all the upgrades and windows #num really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul OS#GENERAL
i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
all i needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there #
i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i know its not my internet connection because i have an hp as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info i have on it #
i m so disappointed LAPTOP#GENERAL
disclaimer i m a mac user #
i wanted to love this laptop which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs before my new university gave me one #
in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces OPTICAL_DRIVES#QUALITY
in addition no matter what i do to change the settings add delete flash etc firefox hangs on start up SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on COMPANY#GENERAL
the cords always feel like they are in my way LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES
it s a pleasure to type on KEYBOARD#USABILITY
my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
if you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
it s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
if you have zero dollars consider it #
if you want ease of use and long term happiness buy a macbook #
great for games LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it s truly a great laptop for the price LAPTOP#PRICE
i built my own gaming pc with a intel i #num #num in it and a gtx #num so i know what crazy performance on a computer can come to #
however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
for #num which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards DISPLAY#GENERAL
if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on medium low settings but i certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web browsing LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS

the laptop died two days after i received it LAPTOP#QUALITY
i purchased a dell inspiron i #num #num bk and so far i love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks LAPTOP#PRICE
if you re looking for a basic pc this is the way to go LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS

in all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless LAPTOP#GENERAL
i just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it took almost #num minutes to boot up LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
please people dont make the same mistake i did LAPTOP#GENERAL
this is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you LAPTOP#PRICE
would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it was not responsive at all to touch MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
very frustrating #
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse MOUSE#USABILITY
if they can fix this i think it would be a very nice cost effective laptop LAPTOP#PRICE
this laptop broke within the first hour of use LAPTOP#QUALITY
the a key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in KEYBOARD#QUALITY
dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes COMPANY#GENERAL
also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises LAPTOP#QUALITY
i m sure i just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one LAPTOP#GENERAL
this laptop is nice LAPTOP#GENERAL
it has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
so frustrating #
i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad MOUSE#USABILITY
i would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand COMPANY#GENERAL

i am loving it completely LAPTOP#GENERAL
it does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much LAPTOP#QUALITY
it doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage LAPTOP#QUALITY
but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying MOUSE#USABILITY
i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else MOUSE#USABILITY
hp please fix it #
a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier MOUSE#USABILITY
uhhhhhh the computer looks good LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

i will never buy another lenovo anything COMPANY#GENERAL
unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop don t buy this MOUSE#GENERAL
the touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i ve worked with have some inherent oddities MOUSE#QUALITY
this one however is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own MOUSE#USABILITY
today it hasn t worked at all more than it has MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the laptop has #num g and a #num #num g processor and it s slower than the four year old toshiba i replaced #

firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around #num kb sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around #num kb sec making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless LAPTOP#USABILITY
get a probook instead #

i am really not happy with this computer LAPTOP#GENERAL
the keyboard is not as easy to use as my old sony #
i don t like windows #num but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
would not buy it again LAPTOP#GENERAL
meh but cheap LAPTOP#PRICE
i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering #
the reviews at the time in late july #num were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost #num star review #
the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus DISPLAY#QUALITY
now the graphics are not hd and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic LAPTOP#QUALITY
so if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine LAPTOP#QUALITY
now the speed is disappointing LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
start up is fine maybe #num secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
even for a #num gb ram it barely chugs with #num tabs open MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i tried all the window updates this worked for a couple of hp laptops i #num in that i bought later at bb to see if it could remove the drag it did not #
really at this point i am trying to confirm if the ram can be upgraded to see if i can do that to help #
couple that with lack of inbuilt bluetooth dvd drive you are looking at a close tie or even a loss compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late august #num #
the hp laptops #num in with i #num core and amd i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram #
but alas they were gifts and what is a gift if not given #
all in all i wish i had waited a bit LAPTOP#GENERAL
but then again hindsight is #num #num #
bought a usb dvd rw drive but have not used it yet #
this laptop is amazing LAPTOP#GENERAL
windows #num #num has its pros and cons OS#GENERAL
the keyboard is backlit but you have to press the f #num key to turn it on KEYBOARD#USABILITY
i was nervous at first that i purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard backlight #
of course this will decrease your battery life LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the sound is very nice and crisp MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
also i have no regrets about going with the #num gb ram because its super fast LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i m still exploring the various features but overall i am satisfied with my purchase LAPTOP#GENERAL

the dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints LAPTOP#QUALITY
it does what it advertises LAPTOP#GENERAL
price is great wish it didn t have windows #num but that is an opinion OS#GENERAL

plus you get #num gb which is also a great feature HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
also the resale value on this will keep LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i highly recommend you get one before they are gone LAPTOP#GENERAL
literally it stays much cooler than my old macbook pro #
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while #
got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn t be happier LAPTOP#GENERAL
the screen is great i don t see the need for a retina display DISPLAY#QUALITY
i also really like the addition of the sd card slot LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
this macbook pro is amazing LAPTOP#GENERAL
if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don t be LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
after not having a disc player i have actually noticed that i never used this disc play in my old laptop either #
however if you really need a disc player apple sells one that connects to your usb port #
i love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
overall this is a fast light practical computer and i highly recommend it LAPTOP#GENERAL
i bought my macbook pro in october of #num and #num years later it still works as flawless as ever LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

i bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i could see the disk drive on the side but it didn t seem to have a button on it OPTICAL_DRIVES#DESIGN_FEATURES
strange #
so i look all over the internet and i checked the settings and there was nothing #
so i looked in the manual and what do i find #
a disk drive with buttons on it OPTICAL_DRIVES#DESIGN_FEATURES
so i called customer support and the man asked for the serial number #
i gave it to him #
and he said quot this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
so beware buyer this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

great color on screen DISPLAY#QUALITY
good speakers from laptop computer MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL
be aware of price differences when purchasing computer #
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product #
amazon has since fixed the price to show the same but it is now higher on both platforms but price is the same now #
my new laptop is great LAPTOP#GENERAL
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp DISPLAY#QUALITY
downloads are real fast compared to my netbook no comparison #
i have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but i like it OS#GENERAL
i would recommend it to anyone LAPTOP#GENERAL
i wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs making word documents powerpoints excels pdfs office is not included #
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the touchpad is a little quot clunky quot for my taste i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES
i appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled quot pinch zoom quot MOUSE#USABILITY
this is larger laptop but is not too heavy LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
battery life is great though it is new BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the power chord is a little short compared to most laptops #
overall a solid laptop for its price LAPTOP#PRICE
this is early days for a review since i took delivery of this only today #
however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage HARD_DISC#GENERAL
it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out LAPTOP#QUALITY
also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be i am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming DISPLAY#GENERAL
to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it LAPTOP#GENERAL
if that changes i will add an update to this #
this is a horrible laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away LAPTOP#QUALITY
it s got a very slow process keys don t respond fast as macbooks #
it s heavy LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i regretted immediately LAPTOP#GENERAL
nothing like the description says LAPTOP#GENERAL
i will never have a windows laptop again #
my apple mac book pro has crashed three times since i purchased it LAPTOP#QUALITY
i do not go on social networks i only do word documents check my email and shopping #
each time apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over SUPPORT#QUALITY
i believe this macbook pro was a lemon right out the gate LAPTOP#QUALITY
my daughter has had her macbook pro longer than i have she goes on every social network possible and has not had one problem #

so far so good i have not encountered any issues with this computer LAPTOP#GENERAL
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value LAPTOP#GENERAL
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
my previous laptop served me well and i am very with its replacement #
to a prospective buyer #num #num #num once you go mac you ll never go back LAPTOP#GENERAL
my wife and i decided to get a mac desktop several years ago #
was the best decision we ever made LAPTOP#GENERAL
it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
we don t have to de frag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed LAPTOP#QUALITY
you can t get a virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two LAPTOP#QUALITY
we have had our desktop for around four years #
my wife has had her macbook pro going on three years and i just purchaced my macbook pro this year #
never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
it s great LAPTOP#GENERAL
because it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse LAPTOP#USABILITY
you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
if you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
lastly because it can flip #num you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard KEYBOARD#USABILITY
i know i didn t get this laptop through amazon but i wanted to write a review #
my dad bought this for me as a birthday gift at the university of utah book store #

very nice LAPTOP#GENERAL
i am pleased with my decision however i have only had this for a few weeks LAPTOP#GENERAL
there are a few things i am dissappointed with though LAPTOP#GENERAL
only #num usb ports LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
most windows laptops have #num to #num or more #
no hdmi port LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
most windows laptops have at least #num #
the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES
not a big deal for me but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac LAPTOP#USABILITY
these are about twice the price of an equivilant windows machine so it was a tough decision but like i said i am pleased so far #
as a student majoring computer science i really fell in love with this laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
what is there not to like #
it s #num #num inches which for me is not too big nor too small LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
it has the latest i #num cpu with a gtx #num m for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under #num seconds with the help of the ssd of course HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
it has #num gb ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
it s not touchscreen DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
how i hate laptops with touchscreen #
i don t have to pay extra for what i hate i mean seriously who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it #
its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and back lit which is nice but what i don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers KEYBOARD#QUALITY
i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good KEYBOARD#QUALITY
this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the #num th generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it s comfortable to have it on my lap because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop s body and not accumulated on the screen like most amp #num hybrid amp #num ones do #
it can run games really well LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
well not really well LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
mobas like dota #num and smite can be run on max quality settings with #num fps or more DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable #num fps is the minimum acceptable fps pcmasterrace DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it s lightweight and easy to carry around LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
the screen is a matte #num p display which is nice but with poor viewing angle DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i find myself adjusting it regularly DISPLAY#USABILITY
it looks sleek and gorgeous LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
blends in with any accessory you use with it LAPTOP#USABILITY
all in all i am very happy with this purchase LAPTOP#GENERAL
and with this price i don t think you can buy anything better LAPTOP#GENERAL
after working on windows laptop and pc over #num years i decided to try this apple laptop #
all i can say is i am impressed LAPTOP#GENERAL
very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box LAPTOP#USABILITY
however there is some learning curve but once you get through it you will admire this product which is expensive compare to windows laptop #
it s worth it LAPTOP#GENERAL
pay me now pay me later i am happy with my choice going with this laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
i was disappointed LAPTOP#GENERAL
it seemed like a great computer and a great deal LAPTOP#PRICE
the first one arrived and it did not work LAPTOP#QUALITY
now i have a two one #
the space bar sticks KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i find it hard to navigate from screen to screen LAPTOP#USABILITY
for a non computer savvy person it was very disappointing LAPTOP#GENERAL
next time i am going back to apple #
i like the #num inch macbooks LAPTOP#GENERAL
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES
i didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it i used it several times LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
installed parallels #num on it and windows #num and windows #num actually works excellent should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the mac os #
the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool POWER_SUPPLY#DESIGN_FEATURES
used my ir remote with it and was kinda glad i didn t buy the retina display or the air #
i don t have any technical pearls to share #
i can provide a review from a layman s viewpoint #
this is my first apple laptop #
i currently own a apple desktop which is usually used to watch movies in my studio #
i have not used my ipad since my mac purchase #
the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
my main use of the mac will be keeping inventory on my jewelry supplies #
once i complete a jewelry piece taking photos and keeping track of sales #
along with email and playing angry birds #
the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises OS#MISCELLANEOUS
i ve been using apple s since #num and this is the fastest and best one i ve had LAPTOP#GENERAL
i wanted an i #num chip and i wanted one i could still work on #
the retinal display laptops don t allow for much tinkering #
i wanted to be able to add my own memory add a second hard drive and in the future replace the battery when it begins to fail #
this mac allows all of that LAPTOP#USABILITY
i don t game a lot so i don t need a super hd display for that i use my appletv to display on my #num amp #num tv #
this is very fast high performance computer LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone LAPTOP#GENERAL
i would not hesitate recommending this to anyone LAPTOP#GENERAL
it fast and easy to set up LAPTOP#USABILITY
i had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ccc and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds i had only dreamed up before LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
with my pc understanding how to jump through hoops is important #
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide LAPTOP#USABILITY
if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon SOFTWARE#USABILITY
this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop LAPTOP#USABILITY
i would ve given #num stars had it not been for the hours of updates i ve had to do to this upon arrival LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
other than that i love it LAPTOP#GENERAL
it s portable reliable and great for what i use it for LAPTOP#GENERAL
positives no matter what position this laptop will stay in it LAPTOP#USABILITY
it s very sturdy LAPTOP#QUALITY
quick boot up and runs efficiently LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
touchscreen is great DISPLAY#GENERAL
negatives as aforementioned my only con was the updates LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
everything you d expect from a mac LAPTOP#GENERAL
it looks and feels solid with a flawless finish LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
only had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side LAPTOP#GENERAL
glad i eventually splashed out and quick delivery from amazon to my place of work #
i put off buying a mac for years #
actually i think i was intimidated by the change from a pc #
i was wrong #
this machine is flawless fast and classy LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc s require #
out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best LAPTOP#GENERAL
i was considering buying the air but in reality this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient even though it s about #num inch thicker and #num lbs heavier #
i m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and i m getting about an #num hour battery life on one charge except i don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the screen has an extremely high resolution that i m very pleased with DISPLAY#QUALITY
even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have only used pcs in the past and it s easy to see that apple is just more advanced #
you will not regret buying this computer LAPTOP#GENERAL
my daughter s macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago BATTERY#QUALITY
it took #num days to make an appointment at the local apple store SUPPORT#QUALITY
i m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand #num for a new battery #num to replace it and #num for a new keyboard SUPPORT#PRICE
i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager SUPPORT#QUALITY
he explained to me the battery expansion is normal SUPPORT#QUALITY
apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care SUPPORT#QUALITY
the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered SUPPORT#QUALITY
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn t consider the product defective SUPPORT#QUALITY
his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear SUPPORT#QUALITY
they will contact you #
he didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his #num #num posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers SUPPORT#QUALITY
here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product COMPANY#GENERAL
steve jobs is dead so is apple COMPANY#GENERAL
no more apple devices in my household COMPANY#GENERAL
please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy COMPANY#GENERAL
i ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem LAPTOP#GENERAL
i can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it s been what we ve been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say LAPTOP#GENERAL
it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and i ve yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early #num s LAPTOP#QUALITY
my #num amp #num macbook s motherboard fried but i think that was a sugar spill that i never bothered cleaning up MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY
oops #
that s the only issue i ve ever had since working on macs in #num LAPTOP#GENERAL
that s a pretty impressive track record don t you think COMPANY#GENERAL
i purchased this laptop back in june #num after doing a lot of research on different laptops i was interested in #
while i have only ever owned hp laptops i made sure to look into other brands including asus dell and microsoft #
however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all LAPTOP#GENERAL
while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks LAPTOP#GENERAL
the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with #num gb of memory and a #num tb #num gb hard drive HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
i really enjoy having all of the extra space especially coming from a laptop with only #num gb of hard drive space #
#num in #num capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus LAPTOP#USABILITY
if you are looking to get a #num in #num laptop this is the laptop you should consider LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things LAPTOP#USABILITY
however the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets #
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable KEYBOARD#QUALITY
battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can usually go about #num hours before i get down to #num battery life BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
my last laptop had terrible battery life lasting only about an hour on a full charge so this isn t too shabby at all for a laptop #
the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
while it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive i do not feel like it is something i absolutely need #
if you are an avid cd listener though or want to watch dvds from your laptop i would suggest buying the separate disc drive #
overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
the touchscreen and #num in #num capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it makes it much more exciting to play LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i m actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it LAPTOP#GENERAL
the seller was great and i had my computer within #num days #
the computer it self is amazing LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for LAPTOP#GENERAL
i wanted a laptop that had a cd drive since most new laptops do not have one a laptop with an actual hard drive since the new macbooks do not and i wanted to get away from pcs #
i actually spent #num on a pc before i bought this macbook and returned it with #num hours because it was slow and i could not stand windows #num #
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is a little sluggish which was to be expected with the #num gb ram but even at its sluggish it is faster than the pc i bought #
i know once i upgrade the ram to #num gb it will pick up a lot MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
as an added bonus i plan on upgraded to #num gb down the road but #num will do for now #
the price for the ram is about #num so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new macbook #
also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus LAPTOP#USABILITY
so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
i know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it s the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use and while it is a little heaver than the macbook air at #num ish pounds its really not that bad #
i highly recommend LAPTOP#GENERAL
this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it s also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about #num LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
it has a #num gb storage capacity but with the option of a #num gb hard drive and a #num #num ghz dual core intel core i #num so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
if your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a mac it s a great buy LAPTOP#GENERAL
otherwise go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the pro #
got it directly from asus #
it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
most system now a days have something great but miss something that you will be looking for #
pros #num nice looks LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
if you can t afford a macbook get this one #
#num keyboard is great KEYBOARD#GENERAL
#num i didn t wanted a #num k or a touch display for laptop #
i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES

#num the fan kicks in even its not too hot FANS_COOLING#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
#num i found the track pad not great MOUSE#GENERAL
i use my mouse so not a problem for me MOUSE#GENERAL
over all very good system and worth it LAPTOP#GENERAL
wonder its hard to get getting sold on a higher price in amazon #
asus always shows sold out #
this was the only tablet style computer so far which met my requirements LAPTOP#GENERAL
it s replacing a first generation surface pro that is too bulky and heavy to effectively use my preference #
i was seduced by this computer so i took it home LAPTOP#GENERAL
the wireless keyboard not bluetooth but rf did not pair up with the device LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i proceeded to make all updates for sony vaio including the bios #
it still did not pair LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i ve used the pairing tool which is located in the windows directory #
i even ran it as administrator still no effect LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i used the ctrl esc keys while turning on and still nothing LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
it s charged the light comes on #
it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i upgraded to windows #num #num and repeated the sequence on software loads #
i still can t pair it LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i don t want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i may give it one more shot tonight then i m returning it to the vendor #
i will update it if i get it working with the procedure #
i m not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard while my return window is still open #
sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product LAPTOP#QUALITY
others have posted about this keyboard issue #
but sony doesn t seem to have addressed it COMPANY#GENERAL
update after the hassle of a return waiting in line then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently i was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer #

thank you amazon #
there are a lot of things a laptop can do these days and if you ask me many of them should be automatically included in every laptop no matter what #
do you remember when computers didn t have cameras on them #
no ok we re looking at a generation gap s here but yes back in the day computers didn t have cameras on them #
now it s unthinkable to buy a computer without one #
this asus you re looking at right here and that i m typing on right now has one LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
with that being said for the price #num you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me it s missing some things that i feel should be automatically included LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
what this laptop does have is windows #num which is confusing as all get out tons of amp #num bloatware amp #num SOFTWARE#GENERAL
i didn t even know what that was until i got this #
this is really nice but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows #num MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
either way highly annoying MOUSE#USABILITY
i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
all works beautifully but windows #num is taking a bit of getting used to OS#USABILITY
i paid the #num for professional version to join it to our server and private business network #
love the #num degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need DISPLAY#USABILITY
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative i could really see MOUSE#GENERAL
this is a fantastic transformer LAPTOP#GENERAL
i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows #num platform DISPLAY#GENERAL
the seller was amazing to work with on my return #
the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate DISPLAY#USABILITY
i would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i m looking forward to needing a laptop update so i can purchase this computer again LAPTOP#GENERAL
i ve only had this for a week overall i like the computer it s thin amp light and the wireless keyboard works great KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i was impressed sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
one thing i did t like is the stylus holder it s cheap plastic and doesn t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i do t use it i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus HARDWARE#QUALITY
the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
when you get a new toy you always want to use it right away #
make sure you follow the directions on the updates i followed the directions and didn t have any problems #

i m overall very pleased with my new laptop LAPTOP#GENERAL
the only downside are the speakers MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
they don t go very loud at all MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#USABILITY

others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but i never use the laptop where i m not looking straight at it so it doesn t bother me DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i m very pleased with the purchase LAPTOP#GENERAL
i just bought this macbook pro a few weeks ago and the user interface was so simple i got used to my computer in a matter of days rather than the year it took for me to master microsoft windows #num #
boot time is super fast around anywhere from #num seconds to #num minute LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
apps launch super fast and the #num gb hdd is more than sufficient HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entry level #num macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for LAPTOP#GENERAL
macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses LAPTOP#QUALITY
furthermore mac os x mountain lion s gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back lit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing KEYBOARD#USABILITY
overall the screen resolution though non retina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work DISPLAY#QUALITY
i still don t get why retina displays are standard on most new ios devices but are only available on the macbook pro with retina display total cheapskate #
the thunderbolt port is awesome PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it s #num gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super fast usb #num #num which also comes with the mbp #
us #num #num comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to #num gbps PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
other ports include firewire #num gigabit ethernet magsafe port microphone jack LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

the glass track pad is large enough for apple s highly acclaimed multi touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers MOUSE#USABILITY
you can also buy one of apple s magic mice which connect to your mac using bluetooth and also allows you to use certain multi touch gestures such as zoom and scroll #

the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal SOFTWARE#GENERAL
the mac app store is your one stop shop for mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk SOFTWARE#GENERAL
there are currently around #num #num apps on the app store and counting and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES
itunes is also you default and also your only media player besides dvd player or any other media players you may come across on the internet #
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it s simple to use user interface SOFTWARE#USABILITY
users switching from a pc will definitely prefer itunes to microsoft s windows media player #
overall the high price of the macbook pro may convince users to buy a cheaper windows pc instead #
but remember you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software which is a joy to work with considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious pc users #

my grand daughter attends kent state university #
seems the whole school at an academic level is going paperless #
she had a pc #
all of her professors and instructors use macintosh #
knowing that i am a mac fan boy it was a no brainer that she asked me for this as a christmas present #
when the macbook pro arrived i helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac an easy drag and drop process utilizing a flash drive LAPTOP#USABILITY
it was delivered with #num gb of ram #num gb on each of two sticks which was probably adequate MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
however i always recommend at least #num gigs so i ordered #num gigs from amazon #
when the ram arrived all #num gigs were on one stick #
so i simply pulled one #num gb stick from the machine and installed the #num gb stick in its place LAPTOP#USABILITY

i will never ever buy any apple product in my life COMPANY#GENERAL
overall i love it LAPTOP#GENERAL
i only have two complaints #
first when i move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn t seem totally solid LAPTOP#QUALITY
i feel like i need to be really gentle with it but maybe that s just me LAPTOP#QUALITY
also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop KEYBOARD#USABILITY

the ssd and i #num complement each other really well HARD_DISC#GENERAL
i was torn between this laptop and the zenbook #
ultimately decided on this one because of the processor and having a fan i read a lot of reviews about the zenbook becoming uncomfortably hot during heavy use which doesn t make sense considering it is a laptop #
i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows #num but it is pretty awesome OS#GENERAL
if you are looking for a light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one LAPTOP#GENERAL
needed a new laptop and went for the windows #num but i hated the new system maybe its just me but could not understand the drastic change and feeling like i had to do more compared to windows #num #

they really know what they are doing LAPTOP#GENERAL
the laptop is so easy to work with LAPTOP#USABILITY
like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very user friendly LAPTOP#USABILITY
its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks LAPTOP#QUALITY
if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac COMPANY#GENERAL
the investment is worth it COMPANY#GENERAL
have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever LAPTOP#GENERAL
most of them were either too big too noisy and too slow after #num years #
mac user interface is just the best OS#USABILITY
have used windows for years so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it you won t feel like going back #
also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
considered macbook air also before buying this pro but glad bought the pro because i didn t fancy carrying a bunch of adapters separate dvd player etc #
honestly didn t see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display so didn t fancy paying that much premium for retina others may fancy that i didn t #
compared other ultrabooks like zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of mac so stuck with macbook #
only thing i dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but i guess you pay for quality LAPTOP#PRICE
not impressed with macintosh products COMPANY#GENERAL
in fact i am completely frustrated COMPANY#GENERAL
i have had the macbook pro for #num #num #num years and i have found that it crashes as much as windows #

durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it LAPTOP#QUALITY
there are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection #

usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers LAPTOP#USABILITY
the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly SOFTWARE#USABILITY

within the first few months that i bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive HARD_DISC#QUALITY
i had been in a training program and had only used word on it #
i went through all of the customer service options #
the online customer service was awful SUPPORT#QUALITY
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile SUPPORT#QUALITY
no one would ever answer my question as to why i couldn t get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty SUPPORT#QUALITY
as a matter of fact no matter how many times i asked that question the employees i spoke purposely ignored it SUPPORT#QUALITY
they didn t say yes and they didn t say no they just pretended that i never asked it which was incredibly frustrating SUPPORT#QUALITY
i ve been to the amp #num genius amp #num bar several times they have been very nice SUPPORT#QUALITY
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so i now have a amp #num refurbished amp #num machine HARDWARE#QUALITY

i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple s amp #num great customer service amp #num and the amp #num reliability of their machines amp #num etc etc blah blah COMPANY#GENERAL
i don t love pcs but every pc i ve ever owned has lasted longer than this macbook which costs much more than any of those pcs #
i m sure most people s macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away COMPANY#GENERAL
i was a long time pc user #
not a geek or a wonk #
pc s were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous #
i had an old laptop running windows xp that i used at home for email #
a couple office products and occasionally watched tv on #
with the eol of xp #
i had to decide if i was going to make a financial commitment to windows upgrade buy new change #
i decided no enough was enough #

what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apple s osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad MOUSE#GENERAL
now the question is who is this computer for #
those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the average computer user will be served better by a macbook air since it is faster for basic tasks lighter and has a higher res antiglare screen #
the macbook pro #num #num inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution DISPLAY#QUALITY
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair LAPTOP#USABILITY
hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge LAPTOP#USABILITY
the processor is roughly #num faster than the one inside the macbook air which also extends this computer s usable lifespan #
the fact that the screen is fairly low res for the price mbp #num has a res of #num x #num while other windows laptops have a res of #num x #num for the same price really detracts from my personal experience with the computer #
the retina display of my iphone #num has indeed spoiled me and apple should update the screen of the mbp #num or bring down the price of the retina model #
this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer s value LAPTOP#GENERAL
lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five star purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer LAPTOP#GENERAL
those looking to drop #num on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker macbook air #
in addition if mac osx is not something you enjoy using then i would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop #
tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive LAPTOP#GENERAL
i am really sorry i bought this machine LAPTOP#GENERAL
i own a #num air a #num macbook pro both prior generations #
i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase #num #

it was time to replace my #num year old laptop and i decided to get a amp #num fancy amp #num mac book pro #

i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough OS#USABILITY
i m a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me #
windows operating system is a superior product by far #
it s actually very obvious #
just look at a market share between the two concepts #
i should have known better LAPTOP#GENERAL
i hope you don t make the same mistake LAPTOP#GENERAL
when i first got the computer i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click MOUSE#USABILITY
this was my first mac so i wasn t familiar with how it was suppose to feel #
after using my friend s computer i knew something was wrong #
i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after #num month of use since it was swelling BATTERY#QUALITY
they tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about #num to replace SUPPORT#QUALITY
they ended up not charging me SUPPORT#QUALITY
other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long i m pretty happy with the computer LAPTOP#GENERAL

the free upgrade to mountain lion failed OS#MISCELLANEOUS
failed #
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
before and after i resolved that issue i saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while i wait for it LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i spend so much time waiting for it LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
although its display is bright and vibrant the os so unusable for work i have moved back to the older and still over performing pc #
the only thing i use this computer for is a safari tester and safari is awful compared to chrome #
i can t believe people like these computers COMPANY#GENERAL
now that they are not virus free l i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long COMPANY#GENERAL
don t waste your money LAPTOP#GENERAL
my hp seemed great at first then the problems started wireless adapter would just quot disappear quot and the system said it didn t have a network card LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
sometimes it comes back sometimes not LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
hp was no help SUPPORT#QUALITY
the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind KEYBOARD#USABILITY
the battery lasted #num months then pffft gone BATTERY#QUALITY
my bud had the same problem #
the aftermarket battery seems better than hp s #
when i had a boot up issue the hp recovery didn t work LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the disks i made wouldn t work hp support stated quot we re a hardware company not a software company quot SUPPORT#QUALITY
microsoft support says to contact the manufacturer hp #
then there was a power cord recall hp never notified us and we did register never again COMPANY#GENERAL
i had issues with acer but my dell s just seem to keep going #
i switched to an apple airbook and love it #

i gave this product #num stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have used this product for only #num days but i can t wait to use it more LAPTOP#GENERAL
i really like mac apple products because of their operating system COMPANY#GENERAL
i have been a linux ubuntu and fedora user for a while because windows doesn t appeal to me and it is similar to ubuntu and fedora but with trackpad gestures notification center and i can run itunes i couldn t get it to run on linux #
i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice OS#USABILITY
i also like i have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if i had any of those OS#USABILITY
the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though amp #num home sharing amp #num i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer but i could not figure that out SOFTWARE#USABILITY
i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i re downloaded my amazon music losing my ratings SOFTWARE#USABILITY
i would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their ios products though there are cheaper options any new computer users as it is easy to learn and anyone who needs to be efficient as the gestures make it very easy to multitask #
i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac apple does not do games well LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time LAPTOP#GENERAL
when i decided to buy my first computer i wish i had bought a mac first LAPTOP#GENERAL
if the price doesn t deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of trouble free operation LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i ve had it for more than a year and i ve found that no anti virus software is needed as long as you don t download anything without being #num sure that it s from a legitimate source LAPTOP#QUALITY
updates and plug ins should also be treated with caution it s a good idea to google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items #
from time to time i get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left LAPTOP#USABILITY
once in a long while that doesn t work in that case i turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved LAPTOP#USABILITY
i ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that i m delighted with my purchase LAPTOP#GENERAL
p s a friend who knows a great deal about computers started with windows then he bought a mac mini #
for a time he used both now he uses his mac exclusively #
nuff said #
received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down MOUSE#USABILITY
when i attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying MOUSE#USABILITY
i went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it MOUSE#USABILITY
thinking i received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed #
if anyone can help me out on this that would be great #
it s a great laptop but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad MOUSE#USABILITY
