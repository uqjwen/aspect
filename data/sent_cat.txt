i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every #num months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed QUALITY;SUPPORT
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them SUPPORT
it s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them SUPPORT
and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended SUPPORT
long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in QUALITY;SUPPORT

overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from GENERAL;DESIGN_FEATURES
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you SUPPORT

the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all OS

the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard unknown

one suggestion i do have is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc unknown
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs SOFTWARE
having someone give you a quick tour of how to s is the best unknown

the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire #num #num hours of battery life five days a week DISPLAY
additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshiba specific software that may or may not be to a user s liking SOFTWARE
i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro unknown

as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy unknown
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks GENERAL;SUPPORT
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed SUPPORT
two of the times was in one month unknown
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it unknown
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done SUPPORT
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in SUPPORT
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions KEYBOARD
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose POWER_SUPPLY
this has happened three times so far unknown
two times with in one month unknown
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it unknown
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good POWER_SUPPLY
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there POWER_SUPPLY
the mac book pro performs flawlessly OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
never had a single problem and don t have to worry about viruses GENERAL;QUALITY
while i mostly use it for email internet and gaming i m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ve come to appreciate from mac laptops MISCELLANEOUS
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment GENERAL
right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously GENERAL;MISCELLANEOUS
it even has a great webcam and skype works very well DESIGN_FEATURES;MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES;SOFTWARE
the fact that you can spend over #num on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine GENERAL
the windows #num starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics OS
i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price OS;PRICE;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;GENERAL
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks MISCELLANEOUS

finally i should note that i took the #num gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time unknown
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them GENERAL;COMPANY
little short on ram but you get what you pay for MEMORY
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch pad making the touch pad hard to use when using headphones mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person PORTS;MOUSE;DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
i love windows #num but i can t give toshiba any credit for that unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time OS;USABILITY;DESIGN_FEATURES;COMPANY
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l #num d s #num laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty GENERAL;SUPPORT
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june #num and returned on july #num seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned SHIPPING;SUPPORT
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot unknown
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place SUPPORT
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba SHIPPING
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue SHIPPING
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some #num miles by air to louisville ky SHIPPING
by air sounds more like by truck to me unknown
and toshiba is totally unconcerned SUPPORT
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter SUPPORT
we don t mind and you don t matter SUPPORT
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter GENERAL;COMPANY
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you don t matter SUPPORT
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service OS;USABILITY

my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in PORTS
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range HARDWARE;PRICE

very fast boot up and shut down OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing e mail etc MISCELLANEOUS
i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc OS
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the only time i have restarted is during system updates OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one GENERAL
ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple GENERAL
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum QUALITY
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro this thing holds its own unknown
the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx #num functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software CPU;OS;GRAPHICS
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc unknown
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one GENERAL
i like it so much i bought another just for my wife GENERAL

first things first macbook pro has many applications to make life easier unlike the windows computers unknown
amazing quality QUALITY

the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc DISPLAY
the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x MISCELLANEOUS;OS
mac is not made for gaming MISCELLANEOUS
but there s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows SOFTWARE
second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated QUALITY;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
was not happy with one of the programs on it SOFTWARE
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial SOFTWARE
also the extended warranty was a problem WARRANTY
the extended warranty for the #num and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu WARRANTY
overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves USABILITY;DISPLAY;GENERAL
i took #num #num years researching brands and prices of laptops unknown
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it PRICE;GENERAL
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased DESIGN_FEATURES
so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority DESIGN_FEATURES
the only thing i didn t learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection in case it gets broken or crashes etc unknown
i don t have that additional money right now and therefore wouldn t have purchased it at this time unknown
those things are very important vital even unknown
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase unknown
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won t have to worry about a crash COMPANY
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection unknown
thank you unknown
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it GENERAL
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning SOFTWARE
it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it SOFTWARE
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem SOFTWARE
well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes SOFTWARE
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you don t save your files and information everything will be lost OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
another issue i have with it is the battery BATTERY
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden BATTERY
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge BATTERY
it is not even a year old yet so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone QUALITY;GENERAL

it runs very quiet too which is a plus QUALITY
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible BATTERY
they only stay charged a little over an hour BATTERY
laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery BATTERY
this a starter notebook unknown
the processor a amd semprom at #num #num ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing CPU
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv DESIGN_FEATURES;CONNECTIVITY
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor unknown
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations unknown
it is a cheap throw together QUALITY

i paid about #num for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me DESIGN_FEATURES;QUALITY;PRICE
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing SUPPORT

i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble SUPPORT;GENERAL

i was psyched unknown
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn t go onto our wireless network and i wouldn t have the same problems because it was updated unknown

i had to call apple #num times each time #num to #num minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics #num times SUPPORT
this is what they told me it heats up and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops and simply categorize them as portables unknown
you might think i am new in this game but i am a gadget lover and have had more than #num dozens laptops in the past #num years and none gets this hot that fast unknown
i also experience the same with my macbook air unknown
so you might ask what did apple do for me unknown
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened #num months ago they offered me an itouch #num gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this COMPANY
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby COMPANY
the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times COMPANY
sad very sad unknown
i had meant to purchase the nb #num and bought this one by accident long story unknown
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop DESIGN_FEATURES
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone HARD_DISC
so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message SUPPORT
i have had the netbook for #num months and i love it i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use unknown
also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
would highly recommend this netbook though GENERAL
i paid for extra memory and the #num inch screen as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners unknown

i visited the apple store and was impressed with the #num inch macbook pro unknown
the quality engineering design and warranty are superior covers damage from dropping the laptop unknown
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note unknown
this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only #num months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice GENERAL;QUALITY
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often SOFTWARE;DESIGN_FEATURES;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal GENERAL

this computer had exactly the specifications i needed DESIGN_FEATURES
small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips DESIGN_FEATURES;PORTABILITY;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the perfect notebook GENERAL
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port CONNECTIVITY
called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting SUPPORT
no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity SUPPORT
needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless CONNECTIVITY
with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone SUPPORT;COMPANY

the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question SUPPORT
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site unknown
i m tired of the inept service SUPPORT
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus COMPANY
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small POWER_SUPPLY
i m really frustrated by this experience GENERAL
how does the power supply not work POWER_SUPPLY
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter so it s not just an isolated incident unknown

i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv GENERAL;MISCELLANEOUS

apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products DESIGN_FEATURES;COMPANY
it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better SOFTWARE;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple #num #num macbook pro notebook computer z #num j #num notebook for all your needs GENERAL
it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them GENERAL;COMPANY
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated but once you get past the initial expense you ll find that they re worth every penny besides there s always the financing plan that best buy offers unknown
the #num macbook pro is portable durable and very capable QUALITY;PORTABILITY;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it has a #num hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over #num hours BATTERY;MISCELLANEOUS
it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a #num watt lightbulb OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics GRAPHICS;MISCELLANEOUS
it s also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing unknown
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multi touch track pad is amazing OS;MOUSE
typically when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience unknown
however the multi touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming MOUSE
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work MISCELLANEOUS
they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks QUALITY
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv #num in nov of #num unknown

probbly the worst decision we ever made GENERAL
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive #num times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard KEYBOARD;HARD_DISC

pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were GENERAL;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it DESIGN_FEATURES
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have KEYBOARD
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard KEYBOARD
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer GENERAL
first it does not have a push button to open the lid DESIGN_FEATURES
it is held in place magnetically DESIGN_FEATURES
there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
once open the leading edge is razor sharp DESIGN_FEATURES
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
using this machine is like a mild form of torture USABILITY
in the shop these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it get it home break the seal and use it very clever con unknown
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare MOUSE
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening MOUSE
also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it KEYBOARD
i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would GENERAL
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features USABILITY;DESIGN_FEATURES
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use GENERAL;USABILITY

of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie SOFTWARE;DESIGN_FEATURES
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems QUALITY
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too DISPLAY
i m hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross unknown
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows #num on it by using the vmware program USABILITY
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;GENERAL;USABILITY
i also got the added bonus of a #num hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh MISCELLANEOUS
i never have had a good result with this computer GENERAL
i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad QUALITY

dell is a decently made pc GENERAL
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks unknown
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side GRAPHICS;DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro #num to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop GENERAL

i really like the video option on it i stream movies on amazon prime and netflix and there is no lag DESIGN_FEATURES;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

now i lay a pillow on my lap first unknown
problem solved unknown

the pc is works well with a good battery and a power cable and has a web cam OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;BATTERY;DESIGN_FEATURES

i m very happy with my acer it does just for what i need it GENERAL
even the sound is fantastic MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
i love this laptop GENERAL
even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design DESIGN_FEATURES
although i ve had it for less than a week i am very satisfied GENERAL

if it had a #num #num star option that is what i would give GENERAL
the build is perfect the screen fantastic but i do have a bit of a problem with the fact that i have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect QUALITY;DISPLAY;CONNECTIVITY;USABILITY

#num great display DISPLAY
love the color accuracy DISPLAY
#num very decent speakers MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
#num fairly fast OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
#num loud fan when watching #num k video off youtube FANS_COOLING
sounds like a washer FANS_COOLING

#num best to use the power supply for #num k video viewing unknown
battery power laptop had difficulties computing OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;USABILITY
#num still feels too heavy to me DESIGN_FEATURES
could lose another pound or two DESIGN_FEATURES
#num expensive PRICE
paid close to #num out the door PRICE
there are too many things to test unknown
will update my review when i have time unknown
biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased QUALITY
bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a dell in the past which was a great computer unknown
this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;QUALITY
it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for #num minutes OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine unknown
the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;QUALITY
and i have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them unknown
what a lemon QUALITY
this is a big disappointment GENERAL
i only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that MISCELLANEOUS
it takes a long time to load any page OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely #num times OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;QUALITY
had to call dell to get it back online unknown
i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop GENERAL;COMPANY
never again unknown
i ve always sworn by dell COMPANY
my very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me unknown
it was stubborn as hell no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it unknown
it worked super fast and got the job done unknown
so with this new order all the upgrades and windows #num really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul DESIGN_FEATURES;OS
i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
all i needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there unknown
i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;CONNECTIVITY
i know its not my internet connection because i have an hp as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info i have on it unknown
i m so disappointed GENERAL
disclaimer i m a mac user unknown
i wanted to love this laptop which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs before my new university gave me one unknown
in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces POWER_SUPPLY;SUPPORT;OPTICAL_DRIVES
in addition no matter what i do to change the settings add delete flash etc firefox hangs on start up SOFTWARE
it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on DESIGN_FEATURES;COMPANY
the cords always feel like they are in my way DESIGN_FEATURES
one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual KEYBOARD
it s a pleasure to type on KEYBOARD
my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away MISCELLANEOUS
if you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it PORTABILITY
it s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down PORTABILITY;DESIGN_FEATURES;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
if you have zero dollars consider it unknown
if you want ease of use and long term happiness buy a macbook unknown
great for games MISCELLANEOUS
it s truly a great laptop for the price GENERAL;PRICE
i built my own gaming pc with a intel i #num #num in it and a gtx #num so i know what crazy performance on a computer can come to unknown
however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years MISCELLANEOUS;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
for #num which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value PRICE;GENERAL
it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards DISPLAY
if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on medium low settings but i certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming MISCELLANEOUS
overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web browsing MISCELLANEOUS
would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant MISCELLANEOUS
this computer is very slow OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i love this laptop GENERAL
it does everything i need it too GENERAL
very good price PRICE

they are loud and clunky but i figured i d get used to it MOUSE

the laptop died two days after i received it QUALITY
i purchased a dell inspiron i #num #num bk and so far i love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks GENERAL;DISPLAY;PRICE
if you re looking for a basic pc this is the way to go MISCELLANEOUS
the hinges on this pc are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the pc QUALITY
i was surprised at the overall quality and the price QUALITY;PRICE
in all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;GENERAL
i just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it took almost #num minutes to boot up OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
please people dont make the same mistake i did GENERAL
this is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you GENERAL;PRICE
would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly GENERAL;MOUSE
it was not responsive at all to touch MOUSE
very frustrating unknown
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse MOUSE
if they can fix this i think it would be a very nice cost effective laptop GENERAL;PRICE
this laptop broke within the first hour of use QUALITY
the a key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in KEYBOARD
dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes COMPANY
also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises QUALITY
i m sure i just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one QUALITY;GENERAL
this laptop is nice GENERAL
it has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough QUALITY;DISPLAY;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive MOUSE
so frustrating unknown
i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped MOUSE
also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad MOUSE
i would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand GENERAL;COMPANY
no lenovo for me COMPANY

now i have dual booted my laptop to windows #num #num and ubuntu #num #num and it s not got too slow either OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i am loving it completely GENERAL
it does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much QUALITY
it doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage QUALITY
but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying MOUSE
i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else MOUSE
hp please fix it unknown
a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier MOUSE
uhhhhhh the computer looks good DESIGN_FEATURES
but it works really slowwwwww OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

i will never buy another lenovo anything GENERAL;COMPANY
unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop don t buy this MOUSE
the touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i ve worked with have some inherent oddities MOUSE
this one however is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own MOUSE
today it hasn t worked at all more than it has MOUSE
the laptop has #num g and a #num #num g processor and it s slower than the four year old toshiba i replaced unknown
it hangs freezes and just isn t working properly OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
though i don t have much installed i only have #num of the #num g left MISCELLANEOUS

excellent buy GENERAL
the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon GENERAL
firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing DESIGN_FEATURES
ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on DESIGN_FEATURES
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled CONNECTIVITY
also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around #num kb sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around #num kb sec making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless CONNECTIVITY;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;USABILITY
get a probook instead unknown

dell support was awful to deal with SUPPORT

meh but cheap GENERAL;PRICE
i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering unknown
the reviews at the time in late july #num were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost #num star review unknown
the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus DESIGN_FEATURES;PORTABILITY;DISPLAY
now the graphics are not hd and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic GRAPHICS;QUALITY
so if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine QUALITY
now the speed is disappointing OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
start up is fine maybe #num secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
even for a #num gb ram it barely chugs with #num tabs open OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;MEMORY
i tried all the window updates this worked for a couple of hp laptops i #num in that i bought later at bb to see if it could remove the drag it did not unknown

the hp laptops #num in with i #num core and amd i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram unknown

the touchpad is a little quot clunky quot for my taste i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event MOUSE

this is early days for a review since i took delivery of this only today unknown
however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead DESIGN_FEATURES
well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage GENERAL;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;HARD_DISC
it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out DESIGN_FEATURES;QUALITY

this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the #num th generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat QUALITY;FANS_COOLING;CPU
it s comfortable to have it on my lap because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop s body and not accumulated on the screen like most amp #num hybrid amp #num ones do unknown
it can run games really well MISCELLANEOUS

the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us MISCELLANEOUS
with my pc understanding how to jump through hoops is important unknown
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide USABILITY
if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon SOFTWARE
this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop USABILITY
i would ve given #num stars had it not been for the hours of updates i ve had to do to this upon arrival GENERAL;MISCELLANEOUS

out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best GENERAL
i was considering buying the air but in reality this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient even though it s about #num inch thicker and #num lbs heavier unknown
i m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and i m getting about an #num hour battery life on one charge except i don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster KEYBOARD;BATTERY
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

my daughter s macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago BATTERY
it took #num days to make an appointment at the local apple store SUPPORT
i m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand #num for a new battery #num to replace it and #num for a new keyboard SUPPORT
i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager SUPPORT
he explained to me the battery expansion is normal SUPPORT
apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care SUPPORT
the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered SUPPORT
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn t consider the product defective SUPPORT
his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear SUPPORT
they will contact you unknown
he didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his #num #num posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers SUPPORT
here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product COMPANY
steve jobs is dead so is apple COMPANY
no more apple devices in my household COMPANY
please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy BATTERY;COMPANY
i ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem QUALITY;GENERAL

however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more GENERAL
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all GENERAL
while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks PRICE;GENERAL
the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with #num gb of memory and a #num tb #num gb hard drive MEMORY;HARD_DISC
that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers HARD_DISC
i really enjoy having all of the extra space especially coming from a laptop with only #num gb of hard drive space unknown
#num in #num capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
if you are looking to get a #num in #num laptop this is the laptop you should consider MISCELLANEOUS
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things USABILITY
however the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets unknown
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable KEYBOARD
battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far BATTERY
i can usually go about #num hours before i get down to #num battery life BATTERY
my last laptop had terrible battery life lasting only about an hour on a full charge so this isn t too shabby at all for a laptop unknown
the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes DESIGN_FEATURES
however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive DESIGN_FEATURES
while it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive i do not feel like it is something i absolutely need unknown
if you are an avid cd listener though or want to watch dvds from your laptop i would suggest buying the separate disc drive unknown
overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop GENERAL
the touchscreen and #num in #num capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes DISPLAY;DESIGN_FEATURES;PORTABILITY
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop MISCELLANEOUS
it makes it much more exciting to play MISCELLANEOUS
i m actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it GENERAL
the seller was great and i had my computer within #num days unknown
the computer it self is amazing GENERAL
it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for MISCELLANEOUS;GENERAL
i wanted a laptop that had a cd drive since most new laptops do not have one a laptop with an actual hard drive since the new macbooks do not and i wanted to get away from pcs unknown
i actually spent #num on a pc before i bought this macbook and returned it with #num hours because it was slow and i could not stand windows #num unknown
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true GENERAL
it is a little sluggish which was to be expected with the #num gb ram but even at its sluggish it is faster than the pc i bought unknown
i know once i upgrade the ram to #num gb it will pick up a lot MEMORY
as an added bonus i plan on upgraded to #num gb down the road but #num will do for now unknown
the price for the ram is about #num so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new macbook unknown
also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus USABILITY
so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop GENERAL
i know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for MISCELLANEOUS
it s the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use and while it is a little heaver than the macbook air at #num ish pounds its really not that bad unknown
i highly recommend GENERAL
this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life MISCELLANEOUS
it s also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art DESIGN_FEATURES;BATTERY
though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device PRICE;DESIGN_FEATURES
when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about #num DESIGN_FEATURES
it has a #num gb storage capacity but with the option of a #num gb hard drive and a #num #num ghz dual core intel core i #num so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too HARD_DISC;CPU;MISCELLANEOUS
if your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a mac it s a great buy GENERAL
otherwise go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the pro unknown
got it directly from asus unknown
it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need DESIGN_FEATURES

#num viewing angles are not great DISPLAY
#num remember its a dual core CPU
#num the fan kicks in even its not too hot FANS_COOLING

over all very good system and worth it GENERAL
wonder its hard to get getting sold on a higher price in amazon unknown
asus always shows sold out unknown
this was the only tablet style computer so far which met my requirements GENERAL
it s replacing a first generation surface pro that is too bulky and heavy to effectively use my preference unknown

i m not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard while my return window is still open unknown
sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product QUALITY
others have posted about this keyboard issue unknown
but sony doesn t seem to have addressed it COMPANY
update after the hassle of a return waiting in line then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently i was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer unknown

there are a lot of things a laptop can do these days and if you ask me many of them should be automatically included in every laptop no matter what unknown
do you remember when computers didn t have cameras on them unknown
no ok we re looking at a generation gap s here but yes back in the day computers didn t have cameras on them unknown
now it s unthinkable to buy a computer without one unknown
this asus you re looking at right here and that i m typing on right now has one DESIGN_FEATURES
with that being said for the price #num you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me it s missing some things that i feel should be automatically included PRICE;GENERAL;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;DESIGN_FEATURES
this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen DISPLAY;DESIGN_FEATURES
what this laptop does have is windows #num which is confusing as all get out tons of amp #num bloatware amp #num DESIGN_FEATURES;OS;SOFTWARE
i didn t even know what that was until i got this unknown
this is really nice but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows #num GENERAL;MOUSE
either way highly annoying MOUSE
i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well CONNECTIVITY
all works beautifully but windows #num is taking a bit of getting used to OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;OS
i paid the #num for professional version to join it to our server and private business network unknown
love the #num degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need DESIGN_FEATURES;DISPLAY
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative i could really see GENERAL;MOUSE
this is a fantastic transformer GENERAL
i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows #num platform GENERAL;DISPLAY
the seller was amazing to work with on my return unknown
the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate SOFTWARE;DISPLAY
i would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase GENERAL;MISCELLANEOUS
it s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen GENERAL;DISPLAY

i ve only had this for a week overall i like the computer it s thin amp light and the wireless keyboard works great GENERAL;DESIGN_FEATURES;KEYBOARD
i was impressed sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger DESIGN_FEATURES
one thing i did t like is the stylus holder it s cheap plastic and doesn t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port HARDWARE;DESIGN_FEATURES
i do t use it i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus HARDWARE
the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it MISCELLANEOUS

the only downside are the speakers MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
they don t go very loud at all MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
the screen looked fine to me and wasn t an issue like others have been saying DISPLAY

this thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but i never use the laptop where i m not looking straight at it so it doesn t bother me DISPLAY
i m very pleased with the purchase GENERAL
i just bought this macbook pro a few weeks ago and the user interface was so simple i got used to my computer in a matter of days rather than the year it took for me to master microsoft windows #num unknown
boot time is super fast around anywhere from #num seconds to #num minute OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
apps launch super fast and the #num gb hdd is more than sufficient SOFTWARE;HARD_DISC
i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entry level #num macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for MISCELLANEOUS;GENERAL
macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses QUALITY
furthermore mac os x mountain lion s gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed OS;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back lit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing KEYBOARD
overall the screen resolution though non retina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work DISPLAY
i still don t get why retina displays are standard on most new ios devices but are only available on the macbook pro with retina display total cheapskate unknown
the thunderbolt port is awesome PORTS

the glass track pad is large enough for apple s highly acclaimed multi touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers MOUSE
you can also buy one of apple s magic mice which connect to your mac using bluetooth and also allows you to use certain multi touch gestures such as zoom and scroll unknown

itunes is also you default and also your only media player besides dvd player or any other media players you may come across on the internet unknown
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it s simple to use user interface SOFTWARE
users switching from a pc will definitely prefer itunes to microsoft s windows media player unknown
overall the high price of the macbook pro may convince users to buy a cheaper windows pc instead unknown
but remember you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software which is a joy to work with considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious pc users unknown

i wish this company to go bust COMPANY
i will never ever buy any apple product in my life COMPANY
overall i love it GENERAL
i only have two complaints unknown
first when i move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn t seem totally solid QUALITY
i feel like i need to be really gentle with it but maybe that s just me QUALITY
also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop KEYBOARD
first off amazing laptop GENERAL
i ve had my fair share of mobile devices aka laptops made by hp or some other company but this is wonderful unknown

if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac GENERAL;COMPANY
the investment is worth it GENERAL;COMPANY
have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever GENERAL
most of them were either too big too noisy and too slow after #num years unknown
mac user interface is just the best OS
have used windows for years so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it you won t feel like going back unknown
also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over QUALITY;DISPLAY;KEYBOARD;DESIGN_FEATURES
considered macbook air also before buying this pro but glad bought the pro because i didn t fancy carrying a bunch of adapters separate dvd player etc unknown
honestly didn t see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display so didn t fancy paying that much premium for retina others may fancy that i didn t unknown
compared other ultrabooks like zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of mac so stuck with macbook unknown
only thing i dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but i guess you pay for quality QUALITY;PRICE
not impressed with macintosh products COMPANY

be sure the programs you need will work on a mac before you buy one USABILITY
the macbook pro with a #num #num inch screen was the first computer i ever purchased unknown
i had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use GENERAL

the criteria that i used to evaluate the macbook pro ranges from reliability to simple usability unknown
reliability throughout the past few years i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws DESIGN_FEATURES;OS
durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it QUALITY
there are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection unknown

usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers USABILITY
the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly DESIGN_FEATURES;SOFTWARE
the macbook pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes GENERAL
pros o it usually runs very smoothly but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;SUPPORT
o it is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options unknown
o it has an extended battery life BATTERY

cons o some people don t enjoy the way the processing system runs but don t have any issues with getting it to function OS

i hope my customer review has been useful feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review unknown
my first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also brilliant DESIGN_FEATURES
so far so good GENERAL
battery doesn t hold up to what it said in the description but i got it refurb d and i imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price just a guess BATTERY;PRICE
still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where i was typing KEYBOARD;MOUSE
practice i guess unknown
plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop i really don t have anything to compare it to DESIGN_FEATURES
note no dvd drive no ethernet port DESIGN_FEATURES
screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger DISPLAY
the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light DISPLAY
keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best KEYBOARD
the touch pad feel is a #num on scale #num #num MOUSE
computer seemed sluggish for an intel core i #num device OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
power on good luck finding it DESIGN_FEATURES;USABILITY
i would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy GENERAL;PRICE
signed not impressed GENERAL
i bought this a few months ago and it s holding up fairly well GENERAL
runs fast the touch screen hasn t lost any sensitivity i m overall very happy with it OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;DISPLAY;GENERAL
the only thing i miss from my old laptop was the ability to be able to scroll down a page using the track pad unknown
this one doesn t do that MOUSE
the trackpad is pretty crappy but aren t they all MOUSE
this is my first apple computer and i couldn t be more pleased GENERAL
ios does everything its billed to do and much much more OS
literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind OS
i can t believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes OS
the computer of the people GENERAL
i love this laptop GENERAL
i feel like my old laptop is a total price of crap now unknown
the battery lasts as long as claimed BATTERY
i get about #num or so hours playing the sims BATTERY
i haven t really officially tested it yet but it s a long time BATTERY
i hate plugging my laptop in because i don t want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it BATTERY
the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus DISPLAY
the only problem i have is with windows #num OS
i hate windows #num OS
it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes won t let me download things that are harmful to my computer but that s what anti virus software is for lol OS
the wifi rumor hasn t happened to me CONNECTIVITY
the wifi works great CONNECTIVITY
i think it s because i always download my windows updates as reccomended unknown
it feels very well built QUALITY
the metal is very expensive feeling QUALITY
the laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed DESIGN_FEATURES
i m a very weak girl and i could lift this laptop with one hand however i d get tired soon lol PORTABILITY
the #num #num amp #num screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands PORTABILITY
i suggest getting a case unknown
the waterfly cases are very good unknown
i bought my first macbook exactly #num months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when i turned it on #num days ago and the screen was completely black GENERAL;DISPLAY
i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead DISPLAY
as i live in brazil i don t know if is there any local guarantee for my computer unknown
anyone had the same problem unknown
any suggestion for a solution unknown
the best computer i ve ever bought GENERAL
the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files OS;USABILITY
the only issue i had was with the harddrive HARD_DISC
the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer HARD_DISC
luckily that was not the case unknown
replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play USABILITY
i purchased a seagate solid state harddrive the same kind that apple installs originally unknown
and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free SUPPORT
you wont be disappointed with this computer GENERAL
i have been a mac person since #num unknown
i don t want to run a computer i want to use a computer unknown
this md #num ll a handles very much like my imac unknown
it s just a matter of getting used to the touch pad commands MOUSE
thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio the onboard speakers are just terrible MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES
but what should i expect from a unit that is this thin and this light DESIGN_FEATURES
the most disappointing purchase of my life GENERAL
this is my first mac unknown
i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine QUALITY;GENERAL
within the first few months that i bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive HARD_DISC
i had been in a training program and had only used word on it unknown
i went through all of the customer service options unknown
the online customer service was awful SUPPORT
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile SUPPORT
no one would ever answer my question as to why i couldn t get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty SUPPORT
as a matter of fact no matter how many times i asked that question the employees i spoke purposely ignored it SUPPORT
they didn t say yes and they didn t say no they just pretended that i never asked it which was incredibly frustrating SUPPORT
i ve been to the amp #num genius amp #num bar several times they have been very nice SUPPORT
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so i now have a amp #num refurbished amp #num machine QUALITY;HARDWARE
maybe i m not being reasonable but i don t feel that s the same as a new computer because i didn t pay for a refurbished computer MISCELLANEOUS
i still have weird freezing problems with it and it s pretty slow but it s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple s amp #num great customer service amp #num and the amp #num reliability of their machines amp #num etc etc blah blah SUPPORT;QUALITY;COMPANY
i don t love pcs but every pc i ve ever owned has lasted longer than this macbook which costs much more than any of those pcs unknown
i m sure most people s macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away SUPPORT;COMPANY
i was a long time pc user unknown
not a geek or a wonk unknown
pc s were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous unknown
i had an old laptop running windows xp that i used at home for email unknown
a couple office products and occasionally watched tv on unknown
with the eol of xp unknown
i had to decide if i was going to make a financial commitment to windows upgrade buy new change unknown
i decided no enough was enough unknown
i was tired or hodge lodge of software products security updates malware junk and endless upgrade trauma with windows unknown
i did upgrade my old pc to windows #num but i went with a macbook pro and i am very happy unknown
one os for this platform no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates DESIGN_FEATURES;OS
i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac QUALITY;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;USABILITY
i was told by my daughter that i was amp #num stupid amp #num for spending so much time on a pc just to make it run when most of that amp #num run stuff amp #num is taken care of by apple unknown
i told her amp #num real men amp #num use pc s because of the challenge it keeps you sharp technically unknown
her final response was amp #num whatever amp #num unknown
well she was right whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i m no power user but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i don t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os USABILITY;OS
i did buy office #num for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for #num and that was a steal in my opinion SOFTWARE
otherwise i am happily a mac user GENERAL;COMPANY
for a premium laptop sold in #num the apple macbook pro #num inch base model is about as basic as it gets no ssd no discrete graphics no #num p display and no touch screen GENERAL;GRAPHICS;DESIGN_FEATURES;DISPLAY
but apple does not pretend it has any of these COMPANY
what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apple s osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad SOFTWARE;HARDWARE;OS;DESIGN_FEATURES;BATTERY;KEYBOARD;MOUSE
now the question is who is this computer for unknown
those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs PRICE;MISCELLANEOUS
the average computer user will be served better by a macbook air since it is faster for basic tasks lighter and has a higher res antiglare screen unknown
the macbook pro #num #num inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;USABILITY;DESIGN_FEATURES;DISPLAY
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair QUALITY;USABILITY
hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge USABILITY
the processor is roughly #num faster than the one inside the macbook air which also extends this computer s usable lifespan unknown
the fact that the screen is fairly low res for the price mbp #num has a res of #num x #num while other windows laptops have a res of #num x #num for the same price really detracts from my personal experience with the computer unknown
the retina display of my iphone #num has indeed spoiled me and apple should update the screen of the mbp #num or bring down the price of the retina model unknown
this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer s value HARD_DISC;PRICE;GENERAL
lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five star purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer PRICE;GENERAL
those looking to drop #num on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker macbook air unknown
in addition if mac osx is not something you enjoy using then i would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop unknown
tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive HARD_DISC;DISPLAY;QUALITY;GENERAL
i am really sorry i bought this machine GENERAL
i own a #num air a #num macbook pro both prior generations unknown
i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase GENERAL
i have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase #num unknown
this machine has made me go there #num times and has been nothing but a continuous problem QUALITY;GENERAL
finally they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement MOTHERBOARD
it s a lemon QUALITY
so i m cooled on mac buys COMPANY
i guess those chinese workers really are unhappy unknown
update november #num #num on my last visit to the genius bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard unknown
it came back today unknown
they did not replace the motherboard SUPPORT
instead they tightened a loose wire SUPPORT
it also has a big new scratch on the top cover SUPPORT
i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix SUPPORT
so i m going back to genius bar for visit #num SUPPORT
i think it may have to be apple don t care instead of apple care SUPPORT;COMPANY
it was time to replace my #num year old laptop and i decided to get a amp #num fancy amp #num mac book pro unknown
you get what you pay for right PRICE;GENERAL
wrong unknown
if you like your windows #num vista or even xp just stick with it unknown
any of those are way simpler to use than apple s mountain lion operating system unknown
mac is complicated and frustrating at moments OS
i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough OS
i m a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me unknown
windows operating system is a superior product by far unknown
it s actually very obvious unknown
just look at a market share between the two concepts unknown
i should have known better GENERAL
i hope you don t make the same mistake GENERAL
when i first got the computer i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click MOUSE
this was my first mac so i wasn t familiar with how it was suppose to feel unknown
after using my friend s computer i knew something was wrong unknown
i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after #num month of use since it was swelling BATTERY
they tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about #num to replace SUPPORT
they ended up not charging me SUPPORT
other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long i m pretty happy with the computer BATTERY;GENERAL
i m a designer turned front end developer and this computer is unusable for front end development MISCELLANEOUS
i have a production pc which was much less expensive and way underspeced compared to this mac unknown
opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever as do all programs that do not begin with an i SOFTWARE;USABILITY
the free upgrade to mountain lion failed OS
failed unknown
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again DISPLAY
before and after i resolved that issue i saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while i wait for it OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i spend so much time waiting for it OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
although its display is bright and vibrant the os so unusable for work i have moved back to the older and still over performing pc unknown
the only thing i use this computer for is a safari tester and safari is awful compared to chrome unknown
i can t believe people like these computers GENERAL;COMPANY
now that they are not virus free l i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long OPERATION_PERFORMANCE;PRICE;QUALITY;COMPANY
don t waste your money GENERAL
my hp seemed great at first then the problems started wireless adapter would just quot disappear quot and the system said it didn t have a network card GENERAL;CONNECTIVITY
sometimes it comes back sometimes not CONNECTIVITY
hp was no help SUPPORT
the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind KEYBOARD
the battery lasted #num months then pffft gone BATTERY
my bud had the same problem unknown
the aftermarket battery seems better than hp s unknown
when i had a boot up issue the hp recovery didn t work MISCELLANEOUS

i gave this product #num stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price PRICE;GENERAL
i have used this product for only #num days but i can t wait to use it more GENERAL
i really like mac apple products because of their operating system OS;COMPANY
i have been a linux ubuntu and fedora user for a while because windows doesn t appeal to me and it is similar to ubuntu and fedora but with trackpad gestures notification center and i can run itunes i couldn t get it to run on linux unknown
i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice OS
i also like i have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if i had any of those OS
the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though amp #num home sharing amp #num i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer but i could not figure that out SOFTWARE
i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i re downloaded my amazon music losing my ratings SOFTWARE
i would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their ios products though there are cheaper options any new computer users as it is easy to learn and anyone who needs to be efficient as the gestures make it very easy to multitask unknown
i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac apple does not do games well MISCELLANEOUS
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time GENERAL
when i decided to buy my first computer i wish i had bought a mac first GENERAL
if the price doesn t deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of trouble free operation PRICE;OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i ve had it for more than a year and i ve found that no anti virus software is needed as long as you don t download anything without being #num sure that it s from a legitimate source QUALITY
updates and plug ins should also be treated with caution it s a good idea to google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items unknown
from time to time i get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left USABILITY
once in a long while that doesn t work in that case i turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved USABILITY
i ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that i m delighted with my purchase GENERAL
p s a friend who knows a great deal about computers started with windows then he bought a mac mini unknown
for a time he used both now he uses his mac exclusively unknown
nuff said unknown
received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed GENERAL;MOUSE
to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down MOUSE
when i attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying MOUSE
i went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it MOUSE
thinking i received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed unknown
if anyone can help me out on this that would be great unknown
it s a great laptop but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad GENERAL;MOUSE
