as a lifelong windows user i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document

oh my goodness i am not a happy camper
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my hp is very heavy
0 1 0 0 0
not easy to carry
0 0 0 0
the battery has never worked well
0 1 0 0 0 0
the battery gets so hot it is scary
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yet hp won t do anything about the problem
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for #num months
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
currently if i use the laptop i can t sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well they don t care a bunch
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and if you are going to deal with hp be careful
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in my house hp is a nasty word

since i purchased my toshiba netbook i have been very pleased with it i have a laptob and a desktop
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have not have any problems
0 0 0 0 0 0
the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me
0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
he gave me this pc about #num years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its still going
0 0 0
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

you will not regret buying such a great thing like this
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it can t get any better
0 0 0 0 0 0

ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this laptop meets every expectation and windows #num is great

it s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network

the battery doesn t last long but i m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i don t use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
the only thing i don t understand is that the resolution of the screen isn t high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes i have it on the highest available setting
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
recommended to people as their first laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets

i m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
being a pc user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i m finding my way around
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the unibody design is edgy and durable
0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
granted it s still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops my mac boots up noticeably quicker
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s more expensive but well worth it in the long run
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
great product very easy to use and great graphics
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
one drawback i wish the keys were backlit
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i m glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few #num extra dollars
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wasn t really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise

this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i purchased this laptop #num months ago
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the dvd burner broke after burning #num dvd d during that time
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within #num days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i spoke to #num different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a #num th person
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
breaking within #num year of purchase and speaking to #num people to report the damaged part will be returned late
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i do not recommend this company or their products
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so far a great product
0 0 0 0 1
high price tag however
0 1 0 0
still trying to learn how to use it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is the worst computer dell ever made
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
breaks easily

only good thing is the graphics quality
0 0 0 0 0 1 0
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the #num reason that is always repeated

this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials

the macbooks worth every penny
0 1 0 0 0
they re easy fun powerful and will last a long time
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the great #num month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills which apple doesn t offer is why i bought my macbook at best buy
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

this just keeps having it s hard drive replaced
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
acer won t replace the laptop
0 0 0 0 0 1
the manufacturer s warranty only covers replacement repair of parts
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
this thing is a lemon
0 0 0 0 0
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern

i was so excited to receive the toshiba l #num as a gift bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have owned it only two months
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my first problem was with the pre loaded norton firewall security program
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it took toshiba tech support #num calls and #num different techs to correct the problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then just the other day my left mouse button snapped
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
being only #num months old i am not a happy camper
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
buyer beware
0 0
this one in my opinion might be a lemon
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses #num times and i have not even had it for more then #num months
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
like the price and operation
0 0 1 0 1
some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc
0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 0
but for the cost this is a winner
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i absolutely love my mac
0 0 0 0 1
i can t imagine my life without it anymore
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i ve haven t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i ve ever bought
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn t work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i saved for this laptop for #num months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the display on this computer is the best i ve seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a little pricey but it is well well worth it
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i ve been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is amazing

in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working #num months of use which was frustrating
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then after #num or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
has a #num #num hour battery life
0 0 0 0 0 1 0
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is easy to use and lightweight
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
was very much worth the price i paid
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
this netbook went bad on me after #num days
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do not buy it

it is the worst laptop ever

the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
small and light weight
0 0 0 1
speakers too small to be of any real use

keyboard good sized and wasy to use
