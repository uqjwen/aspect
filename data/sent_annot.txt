as a lifelong windows user i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document

oh my goodness i am not a happy camper
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my hp is very heavy
0 1 0 0 0
not easy to carry
0 0 0 0
the battery has never worked well
0 1 0 0 0 0
the battery gets so hot it is scary
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
yet hp won t do anything about the problem
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for #num months
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
currently if i use the laptop i can t sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well they don t care a bunch
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and if you are going to deal with hp be careful
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in my house hp is a nasty word

since i purchased my toshiba netbook i have been very pleased with it i have a laptob and a desktop
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have not have any problems
0 0 0 0 0 0
the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me

he gave me this pc about #num years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its still going
0 0 0
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

you will not regret buying such a great thing like this

it can t get any better
0 0 0 0 0 0

ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this laptop meets every expectation and windows #num is great

it s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network

the battery doesn t last long but i m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i don t use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
the only thing i don t understand is that the resolution of the screen isn t high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes i have it on the highest available setting
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

recommended to people as their first laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets

i m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
being a pc user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i m finding my way around
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the unibody design is edgy and durable
0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
granted it s still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops my mac boots up noticeably quicker
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s more expensive but well worth it in the long run
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
great product very easy to use and great graphics
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
one drawback i wish the keys were backlit
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i m glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few #num extra dollars
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wasn t really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise

this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i purchased this laptop #num months ago
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the dvd burner broke after burning #num dvd d during that time
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within #num days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i spoke to #num different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a #num th person
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
breaking within #num year of purchase and speaking to #num people to report the damaged part will be returned late
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i do not recommend this company or their products
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
so far a great product
0 0 0 0 1
high price tag however
0 1 0 0
still trying to learn how to use it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is the worst computer dell ever made
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
breaks easily

only good thing is the graphics quality
0 0 0 0 0 1 0
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the #num reason that is always repeated

this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials

the macbooks worth every penny
0 1 0 0 0
they re easy fun powerful and will last a long time
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the great #num month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills which apple doesn t offer is why i bought my macbook at best buy
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

this just keeps having it s hard drive replaced
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
acer won t replace the laptop
0 0 0 0 0 1
the manufacturer s warranty only covers replacement repair of parts
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
this thing is a lemon
0 0 0 0 0
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern

i was so excited to receive the toshiba l #num as a gift bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have owned it only two months
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my first problem was with the pre loaded norton firewall security program
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it took toshiba tech support #num calls and #num different techs to correct the problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then just the other day my left mouse button snapped
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
being only #num months old i am not a happy camper
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
buyer beware
0 0
this one in my opinion might be a lemon
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses #num times and i have not even had it for more then #num months
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
like the price and operation
0 0 1 0 1
some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc
0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 0
but for the cost this is a winner
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i absolutely love my mac
0 0 0 0 1
i can t imagine my life without it anymore
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i ve haven t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i ve ever bought
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn t work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i saved for this laptop for #num months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the display on this computer is the best i ve seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a little pricey but it is well well worth it
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i ve been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is amazing

in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working #num months of use which was frustrating
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then after #num or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
has a #num #num hour battery life
0 0 0 0 0 1 0
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is easy to use and lightweight
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
was very much worth the price i paid
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
this netbook went bad on me after #num days
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do not buy it

it is the worst laptop ever

the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
small and light weight

speakers too small to be of any real use

keyboard good sized and wasy to use

the screen video resolution won t increase to a higher resolution then #num x #num

that being said it still runs video in full screen decently

the sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones

ever since i bought this laptop so far i ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines

toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them

it s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them

and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended

long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in

this laptop is insane

it s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with

this is definitely a computer worth the money
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
the mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the lcd screen stopped working on mine after #num months

i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat

upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had #num months left on the warranty

after trying to get some help he disconnected on me

after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid

after #num days being denied #num times and told off once i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after that the said it was under warranty
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they don t allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a #num page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn t be covered

i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service

this computer gets very hot before shutting down

i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses without results

they didn t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don t do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so i can t reccomend it if you are in the computer field

in the past four years i ve had it i have never once gotten a virus

i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff

it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all

it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others

this computer was awful
0 1 0 0
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the computer first started malfunctioning #num months after purchasing it
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when calling dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

that s how frustrating it was

it is so simple to use i use it more than my desktop

bought from wal mart i believe that this laptop was a repaired item
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
this laptop was bad from the first day of use brought it back to store for return of money
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
will not every buy another lou
0 0 0 0 0 0
this is a great value for the money
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is a great computer
0 0 0 0 1
we haven t had any problems with it at all
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
overall though for the money spent it s a great deal
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
for example when my husband turns the light out while i m on the computer the screen brightness automatically adjusts
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
oh it is such a great piece of equipment
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
one suggestion i do have is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
having someone give you a quick tour of how to s is the best

so you don t get frustrated the first few weeks
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room

very long life battery up to #num #num hours depending on how you configure power level settings

i play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big #num laptop does
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wouldn t play a first person shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruit named music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in i d highly recommend checking this out

the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire #num #num hours of battery life five days a week

additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshiba specific software that may or may not be to a user s liking

two of the times was in one month

i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it

so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good

right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously

it even has a great webcam and skype works very well
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
the fact that you can spend over #num on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine

the windows #num starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics

the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch pad making the touch pad hard to use when using headphones mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person

cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction

i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l #num d s #num laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty

the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june #num and returned on july #num seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned

the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue

instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some #num miles by air to louisville ky

by air sounds more like by truck to me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and toshiba is totally unconcerned

the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter

the ati graphics card is a huge plus definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built in card would have trouble with such as half life #num or even world of warcraft

my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range

other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi decent gaming capabilities
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
let me start with the good so awesome

this is my second macbook
0 0 0 0 0
the first one i had was a #num model not the pro
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i fell in love with it
0 0 0 0 0 0
this one has had the same effect
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion so i kind of knew what i was getting but hadn t been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi touch features
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual but substantive
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it is everything i d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled lighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness

my real problem with it
0 0 0 0 0
the statement of #num hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it s a lie
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than #num #num hrs out of it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the first full charge of this battery got me only about #num full hours
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
enabling the battery timer is useless
0 0 1 0 0 0
the time remaining goes from #num hours plus to less than #num hours over the span of about #num minutes
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s a joke
0 0 0 0
it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i know what #num hrs of battery looks like
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
this ain t it
0 0 0 0
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you buy this don t go into it expecting #num hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the pro is a great product i wish that the #num inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
great product by apple with the new great looking design
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this computer was bought because i wanted top of the line fast reliable ha
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than #num #num #num years only to get another hp compaq piece of crap
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only #num months
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
so buyers beware

my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after #num days

the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly

the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple

have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a pc with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience

from the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it

if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer

been a pc user for many many years

let me tell you this machine is great
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing e mail etc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only time i have restarted is during system updates

great machine if you want to drop the cash for one

ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro this thing holds its own
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx #num functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i like it so much i bought another just for my wife
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
took it back as it was defective
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
couldn t keep a page up you were working on
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was a great deal i will give that
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the laptop preformed pretty well
0 1 0 0 0
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it has times were it freezes for #num seconds and then starts again
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks
0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
the mouse is way way way to sensitve
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i tried turning it done but it did nothing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
its not bad just very very annoying
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i am very happy with this laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
first things first macbook pro has many applications to make life easier unlike the windows computers
0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
amazing quality
0 1
plus stylish
0 1
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
mac is not made for gaming
1 0 0 0 0 0
but there s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was not happy with one of the programs on it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the extended warranty was a problem
0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the extended warranty for the #num and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i took #num #num years researching brands and prices of laptops
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only thing i didn t learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection in case it gets broken or crashes etc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don t have that additional money right now and therefore wouldn t have purchased it at this time
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
those things are very important vital even
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won t have to worry about a crash
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you don t save your files and information everything will be lost
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
another issue i have with it is the battery
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is not even a year old yet so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
don t waste your money
0 0 0 0 0
this laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of the iphone

the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
overall this laptop is great
0 0 1 0 0
it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it runs very quiet too which is a plus
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
they only stay charged a little over an hour
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this a starter notebook
0 0 0 1
the processor a amd semprom at #num #num ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is a cheap throw together
0 0 0 0 0 0
save your money and go for a better device
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1

i wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect

its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both

everything about this computer is easy to use

the only thing is that the battery won t last more than #num #num an hour
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it discharges too quickly
0 0 0 0
kind of annoying but i still love the laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 0
the only downfall is the volume control
0 0 0 0 0 1 2
the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn t work in real time
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute

i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box

the resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market

i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage

i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem

when i called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me #num for the phone call even though they didn t offer any technical support

i loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
but if you can t make your product last more than a year you will not get my business again

i ve had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in those three years i ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan
0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
after a couple of years my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company wide recall of my particular battery
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
in the three years i ve had my macbook pro i have never had a virus on my computer and i do a lot of work on the internet
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i ve used

i highly recommend this product
0 0 0 0 0
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops but the ease of use security and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
needs constant repair
0 0 0
first the screen goes completely out
0 0 1 0 0 0
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
now the screen is going darker darker darker
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh yeah don t forget the expensive shipping to and from hp
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
i v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so far so good with this laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature

screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
memory is upgradable

the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys

sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money

the macbook is a fantastic laptop

i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
although the price is higher then dell laptops the macbooks are worth the dough

you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot
0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it just works flawlessly
0 0 0 0
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
dells are ok hps aren t that good but macs or fantastic

this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wasn t a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it had the full sized touch pad with #num buttons instead of just one
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this system came loaded with windows #num starter
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so far so good

when i got this laptop in #num to help me with school i had a hard time from beginning
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned

i have had several machines over the years both for personal and business use
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all of them were windows machines
0 0 0 0 0 0
don t get me wrong i am no microsoft hater i ve just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

it was very easy to just pick up and use
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it did not take long to get used to the mac os
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
i had been a windows linux user before this
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto video editing or movie making imovie etc
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the built in webcam is great for skype and similar video chat services

itunes is a handy music management program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod

the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons

the difference in the apple keyboard from a pc s keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to but overall it s worth it

the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail

0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i work in film editing and post production so i need a laptop that not only has power but memory and speed as well
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0

the apple care has never failed me and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well

i will only buy apple laptops from now on

great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household

keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great

my macbook pro has been a huge disappointment

the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly

i ve had my macbook pro since august #num
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
prior to this computer i owned a powerbook g #num for #num years quite a long time for a laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my macbook pro is no exception
0 1 2 0 0 0
on my powerbook g #num i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i didn t like the trackpad
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
since i ve had this computer i ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the display is incredibly bright much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing spreadsheets and presentations similar to microsoft office
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i will never buy anything from hp again

one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase

the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price

this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is

when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
but after i got used to it i love it
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming

it has #num usb ports #num sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have

i tell everyone that i know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the computer blinks it shuts off at will
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
the letter a stopped working after the first week
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is #num twenty three days from the date of purchase
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
not the day received
0 0 0 0
so the fact that the computer does not work on the #num twenty fourth day is my fault
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they have not sent a new one nor called
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to

its sad because their commercials are great

i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair

i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only problems are the sound isnt very loud i have to wear headphones
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed #num to send it in to fix it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay #num to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the #num and it was fixed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it took a little over #num weeks until i got it back
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the graphics are great
0 1 0 0
the internet speed is spectacular
0 1 2 0 0
the battery life is probably an hour at best
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good
0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month

i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this computer doesn t do that well with certain games it can t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is #num for two cds

i bought a hp pavilion dv #num #num nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the battery does not last very long at all
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i would recommend not buying this product
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am stuck with a laptop that i cannot do very much with
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
also i have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
will probably never buy a hp again

purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out
0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
before we got this laptop had a compaq pasaro for #num years with no problems
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i hate it
0 0 0
i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning #num of these laptops
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the first fell apart right after the #num year warranty
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
during that time i had to send it back #num times
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i paid about #num for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about #num for the extended warranty
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i sent it back and they lost it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i waited and waited and no laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i waited another month for approval and for them to build me a new laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i was psyched
0 0 0
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn t go onto our wireless network and i wouldn t have the same problems because it was updated
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hp didn t fix it
0 0 0 0 0
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i use my friends and family s #num laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp well i ll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone

now #num months later they want would not say exact amount #num #num to #num to fix the machine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
now the machine won t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for #num days and now i m out of warranty even though this has been a constant #num month occurance since i bought the netbook
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so buyer beware when buying toshiba
0 0 0 0 0 1
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i also bought one for my wife and #num for my office
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than #num second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i had to call apple #num times each time #num to #num minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics #num times
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is what they told me it heats up and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops and simply categorize them as portables
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you might think i am new in this game but i am a gadget lover and have had more than #num dozens laptops in the past #num years and none gets this hot that fast
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i also experience the same with my macbook air
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so you might ask what did apple do for me
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened #num months ago they offered me an itouch #num gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby

the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times

i had meant to purchase the nb #num and bought this one by accident long story
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message
0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had the netbook for #num months and i love it i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
would highly recommend this netbook though
0 0 0 0 0 0
i paid for extra memory and the #num inch screen as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the leather carrying case keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my laptop cost approximately #num #num and died after only #num years #num months and #num days of use
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
accordingly i have decided to never purchase another hp product my five year old compaq lasted #num years before the hard drive crashed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the #num inch macbook pro
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
the quality engineering design and warranty are superior covers damage from dropping the laptop
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only #num months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the repairs were made quickly though i must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
unable to boot up this brand new laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
spent #num hours on phone with hp technical support
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after #num hours on phone could not fix it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the perfect notebook

when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
summary i ve had this laptop for #num months out of the blue the power adapter stops working
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0
call tech support standard email the form and fax it back in to us
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i called back to ensure that received it they had
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back #num days later to be told that it takes #num #num days for turnaround time
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this was the #num rd day and part still had not been shipped
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
asked the customer service rep
0 0 0 0 0
if it s not shipped on the next business day called on a friday they are closed on weekends what was the next step
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m tired of the inept service
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m really frustrated by this experience
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
how does the power supply not work
0 0 0 1 2 0 0
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter so it s not just an isolated incident

our apple #num #num macbook pro notebook computer z #num j #num notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple #num #num macbook pro notebook computer z #num j #num notebook for all your needs
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated but once you get past the initial expense you ll find that they re worth every penny besides there s always the financing plan that best buy offers
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the #num macbook pro is portable durable and very capable
0 0 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 1
it has a #num hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over #num hours
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a #num watt lightbulb
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it s also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multi touch track pad is amazing
0 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0
typically when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however the multi touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv #num in nov of #num
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
bought with a credit card
0 0 0 0 0
probbly the worst decision we ever made
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive #num times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway #num times they would give us a new one
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
first it does not have a push button to open the lid
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it is held in place magnetically
0 0 0 0 0 0
there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
once open the leading edge is razor sharp
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
using this machine is like a mild form of torture
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in the shop these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it get it home break the seal and use it very clever con
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it
0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
buy this if you like being tortured teased frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s a bummer and one out of five is being kind
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m going to try and keep my old g #num on the road for as long as possible
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used #num different laptops in the past #num years i find not much difference except of course for the screen size
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i like this machine because its very lightweight
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
#num hours of battery life is really something else
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
i highly recommend that you buy this product
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i ve owned every pro model apple laptop for the last #num years this is by far the worst one i ve ever had
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like a pc maybe worse and i loose all my open documents
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i hate it
0 0 0
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i saw this one and i have the most difficult time trying to use them they ve made great dust collectors i hate putting this computer down

i love it

i fine apple mc #num ll a #num #num ghz #num macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s face and depanable

as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it s just a great toy to have around
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very very slow laptop
0 0 1 1
tons of bloatware and junk programs
0 0 1 0 0 1
can t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
amazing machine
0 1
it is a big big but since it has a #num #num screen what would you expect
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it is truly a desktop replacement
0 0 0 0 0 0
very fast and efficient
0 1 0 1
does a great job with video shot on a canon #num d mkii
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very happy with my #num th toshiba laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the computer loads in about a #num #num th of the time that my pc did and i have all of the programs that were on my pc
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
i m hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows #num on it by using the vmware program

the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord

dell is a decently made pc
0 0 0 0 0 0
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro #num to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop

the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems

then within #num months the charger crapped out on me

so i called compaq and after being on the phone for #num hours i finally got a replacement which i shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty

then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went

i had to pay #num for a universal charger for this cheap #num laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
not worth it one bit

the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory

also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after #num months the screen split in half just from everyday use

apparently under the screen there are #num little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose

i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it

it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0
but to be honest i don t use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so this was great for me
0 0 0 0 0 0
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work

i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems

it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me

sadly apple has discontinued this macbook i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros

i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop

i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back

no complaints with their desktop and maybe because it just sits on your desktop and you don t carry it around which could jar the hard drive or the motherboard

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i initially purchased my macbook pro #num in april and i loved it
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i had never owned a mac before
0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0
i was so happy with my new mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
for #num months
0 0 0
then the hard drive failed
0 0 1 2 0
my information was all lost my fault i know but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac the paragon of all computers
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another #num months of my new computer until it froze this morning completely
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can t even turn it off
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s catatonic
0 0 0
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it s like new i might have #num months next time

oh boy

i would rate this computer at #num stars but considering it has a short life span i can only give it #num and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine

this is what a laptop is supposed to be
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i thought the price was great for the specs
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
but after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the keyboard is too slick
0 1 0 0 0
i really don t like it but i am stuck
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
dell latitude d #num is not a reliable machine
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is the first apple product that i have purchased
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very disappointing

i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
about #num #num of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
web access through the #num g network is so slow it s very frustrating and very disappointing

one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after purchasing this thing i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i go to purchase it on line and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hp pavilion dv #num notebook pc when i first got this computer it really rocked

but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing on line through wi fi
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hp said it was out of warranty

guess i ll stay away from hp

my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me but i have just been using firefox instead
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer

i love this computer
0 0 0 1
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere but still has a big enough screen to get everything done
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
everything is so easy to use mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only thing that i don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
games being the main issue
0 0 0 0 0
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can t play it because its not compatable with the software
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
other than that i don t have one complaint in the world
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this computer periodically crashes office iphoto safari

i have been an apple user since they switched to intel

i have had macbook pros and macbook airs and have never had a problem
0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
it seems that this computer might be a lemon
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i purchased it through amazon
0 0 0 0 0
i have had one complaint into the supplier but got little support
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am taking the computer to apple to see what they think
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since i had a student discount but i would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if i had too
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
but if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
count me as extremely satisfied it s a perfect computer

i just bought this computer from the apple store and i couldn t be more impressed with it
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it has a stunning retina display and is very fast
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
the solid state memory makes it a lot faster than previous macbook pro models that used a spinning hard drive
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
this computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth
0 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the hd display is sensational and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no hardware issues as is common with any apple product

average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly

below average on the w fi adapter which i m still trying to get to the bottom of
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if the wi fi adapter will not support duplex operation still trying to get to the bottom of that that s a noticeable drawback i ll be grousing about for the entire time i use it

this is a great home computer

you also have to press firmly on the keys

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but here s something i hadn t realized before buying it there isn t an optical drive which means no cds or dvds

good for basic stuff

don t try to use to play any pc games or anything
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just for simple web browsing and media streaming

pretty premium feel for the low price

i have so much trouble turning the computer on
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my mistake was to not research this one no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i was in a big hurry to buy a computer just to produce a newsletter for my job

i should have waited to find a higher quality computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m very happy this laptop is beatifull is nt slow at all
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
but it doesn t have a cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
just wifi

the screen is big and everything was as described
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for everyday use you can t really go wrong with this laptop

if like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line then this is a winner
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else

it s a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet

now when i say don t expect to play games on it i mean it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
pretty much every major game save for solitare won t even play on it due to the slower processor

the webcam is nothing special its there if you need it

i needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine

performance wise it s a bit slow but that s to be expected from a celeron class processor

i m also not a fan of windows #num but fortunately i can install whatever i want on the laptop without issue

the laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard

this is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptop so far so good after a month
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it took some getting used to on the widows #num #num after being an xp user for many years
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
everything seems to be running smoothly
0 0 0 0 0 0
only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
they are fine while the free subscription is going but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat

don t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag

0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my only concern is that since the battery is not external i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time

lenovo is the best laptop
1 0 0 0 1
built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and the only microphone input is for a combo mike speaker plug
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so to communicate i need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a built in mike

that s a nuisance for family skype calls only one can speak at a time

one really nice thing about lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software

biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a dell in the past which was a great computer
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for #num minutes
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what a lemon

this is a big disappointment

i only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that

it takes a long time to load any page

i ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely #num times
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
had to call dell to get it back online
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
never again
0 0
i ve always sworn by dell
0 0 0 0 0 1
my very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it was stubborn as hell no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it worked super fast and got the job done
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
so with this new order all the upgrades and windows #num really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
all i needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i know its not my internet connection because i have an hp as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info i have on it

i wanted to love this laptop which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs before my new university gave me one
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in addition no matter what i do to change the settings add delete flash etc firefox hangs on start up
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
the cords always feel like they are in my way
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it s a pleasure to type on
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0
if you have zero dollars consider it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you want ease of use and long term happiness buy a macbook
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

i built my own gaming pc with a intel i #num #num in it and a gtx #num so i know what crazy performance on a computer can come to
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years

for #num which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards

if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on medium low settings but i certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web browsing

would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
it was not responsive at all to touch
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very frustrating

and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse

the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0
ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around #num kb sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around #num kb sec making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless

the keyboard is not as easy to use as my old sony

i don t like windows #num but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the reviews at the time in late july #num were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost #num star review
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
now the graphics are not hd and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
so if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine

even for a #num gb ram it barely chugs with #num tabs open

excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a macbook

you can t get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive

all the newer macbooks do not

if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don t be
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0
after not having a disc player i have actually noticed that i never used this disc play in my old laptop either
0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however if you really need a disc player apple sells one that connects to your usb port
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0
overall this is a fast light practical computer and i highly recommend it

so i looked in the manual and what do i find

a disk drive with buttons on it

so i called customer support and the man asked for the serial number

i gave it to him

and he said quot this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the touchpad is a little quot clunky quot for my taste i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size

this is early days for a review since i took delivery of this only today
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be i am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if that changes i will add an update to this
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is a horrible laptop

within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away

my wife and i decided to get a mac desktop several years ago
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was the best decision we ever made
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
we don t have to de frag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed

you can t get a virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two

never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s great
0 0 0
because it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
lastly because it can flip #num you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard

there are a few things i am dissappointed with though

only #num usb ports

most windows laptops have #num to #num or more
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no hdmi port
0 0 1
most windows laptops have at least #num
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
not a big deal for me but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac

as a student majoring computer science i really fell in love with this laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
what is there not to like
0 0 0 0 0 0
it s #num #num inches which for me is not too big nor too small
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it has the latest i #num cpu with a gtx #num m for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under #num seconds with the help of the ssd of course

it has #num gb ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s not touchscreen
0 0 0 0
how i hate laptops with touchscreen
0 0 0 1 0 0
i don t have to pay extra for what i hate i mean seriously who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and back lit which is nice but what i don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the #num th generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat

it s comfortable to have it on my lap because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop s body and not accumulated on the screen like most amp #num hybrid amp #num ones do

mobas like dota #num and smite can be run on max quality settings with #num fps or more
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable #num fps is the minimum acceptable fps pcmasterrace

it s lightweight and easy to carry around
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
the screen is a matte #num p display which is nice but with poor viewing angle

after working on windows laptop and pc over #num years i decided to try this apple laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
all i can say is i am impressed
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however there is some learning curve but once you get through it you will admire this product which is expensive compare to windows laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
it s worth it

it seemed like a great computer and a great deal

the first one arrived and it did not work

for a non computer savvy person it was very disappointing

next time i am going back to apple

i like the #num inch macbooks

its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable

the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad

i didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it i used it several times
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
installed parallels #num on it and windows #num and windows #num actually works excellent should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the mac os

i don t have any technical pearls to share

i can provide a review from a layman s viewpoint
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is my first apple laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0
i currently own a apple desktop which is usually used to watch movies in my studio
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have not used my ipad since my mac purchase
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my main use of the mac will be keeping inventory on my jewelry supplies
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
once i complete a jewelry piece taking photos and keeping track of sales
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
along with email and playing angry birds

the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises

i ve been using apple s since #num and this is the fastest and best one i ve had

i wanted an i #num chip and i wanted one i could still work on

the retinal display laptops don t allow for much tinkering
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wanted to be able to add my own memory add a second hard drive and in the future replace the battery when it begins to fail
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
this mac allows all of that

i don t game a lot so i don t need a super hd display for that i use my appletv to display on my #num amp #num tv

the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
with my pc understanding how to jump through hoops is important
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon

everything you d expect from a mac
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
it looks and feels solid with a flawless finish

the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
only had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
glad i eventually splashed out and quick delivery from amazon to my place of work
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i put off buying a mac for years
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actually i think i was intimidated by the change from a pc
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i was wrong
0 0 0
this machine is flawless fast and classy
0 1 0 0 1 0 0
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc s require
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i was considering buying the air but in reality this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient even though it s about #num inch thicker and #num lbs heavier
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and i m getting about an #num hour battery life on one charge except i don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the screen has an extremely high resolution that i m very pleased with

even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money

i have only used pcs in the past and it s easy to see that apple is just more advanced

you will not regret buying this computer

my daughter s macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
it took #num days to make an appointment at the local apple store
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
i m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand #num for a new battery #num to replace it and #num for a new keyboard
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
he explained to me the battery expansion is normal
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn t consider the product defective
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they will contact you
0 0 0 0
he didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his #num #num posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it s been what we ve been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and i ve yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early #num s
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my #num amp #num macbook s motherboard fried but i think that was a sugar spill that i never bothered cleaning up
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oops
0
that s the only issue i ve ever had since working on macs in #num
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that s a pretty impressive track record don t you think
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i purchased this laptop back in june #num after doing a lot of research on different laptops i was interested in
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
while i have only ever owned hp laptops i made sure to look into other brands including asus dell and microsoft
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with #num gb of memory and a #num tb #num gb hard drive
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i really enjoy having all of the extra space especially coming from a laptop with only #num gb of hard drive space
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
#num in #num capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you are looking to get a #num in #num laptop this is the laptop you should consider
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
however the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i can usually go about #num hours before i get down to #num battery life
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
my last laptop had terrible battery life lasting only about an hour on a full charge so this isn t too shabby at all for a laptop
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes
0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2
while it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive i do not feel like it is something i absolutely need
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you are an avid cd listener though or want to watch dvds from your laptop i would suggest buying the separate disc drive
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the touchscreen and #num in #num capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it makes it much more exciting to play

i m actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the seller was great and i had my computer within #num days
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
the computer it self is amazing
0 1 0 0 0 0
it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i wanted a laptop that had a cd drive since most new laptops do not have one a laptop with an actual hard drive since the new macbooks do not and i wanted to get away from pcs
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i actually spent #num on a pc before i bought this macbook and returned it with #num hours because it was slow and i could not stand windows #num
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it is a little sluggish which was to be expected with the #num gb ram but even at its sluggish it is faster than the pc i bought
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
i know once i upgrade the ram to #num gb it will pick up a lot
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
as an added bonus i plan on upgraded to #num gb down the road but #num will do for now
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the price for the ram is about #num so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new macbook
0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
i know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it s the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use and while it is a little heaver than the macbook air at #num ish pounds its really not that bad
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life

though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about #num
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
it has a #num gb storage capacity but with the option of a #num gb hard drive and a #num #num ghz dual core intel core i #num so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too

if your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a mac it s a great buy
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
otherwise go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the pro
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
got it directly from asus

it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need
